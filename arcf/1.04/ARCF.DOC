ARCF  Find Text in ARC Files.			   Version 1.04  Oct 23, 1987




Purpose:  To search files in ARC archive files for text strings.


Format:   ARCF	[d:][path]filename[.ARC]  [filespecs...]  "text"
		[/B] [/C] [/F] [/Q] [/S] [/W]


Usage:	  The d:path\filename and "text" parameters are required.
	  The drive and path are optional. The 'filename' and
	  'filespec' parameters may contain the wildcard characters *
	  and ?.  All files matching the 'filespec' specification
	  within the 'filename' are processed.

	  If the 'filename' extension is omitted, the extension .ARC
	  is used.

	  The 'text' search criteria must begin and end with a
	  double quote character, e.g. ARCF TEST.ARC "SOMETHING".
|	  You may include the ? character in the search text to
|	  denote "any" character. Thus, "A?C" would produce a match
|	  if "ABC" or "A2C" occurs in the files processed.

	  The optional switch (/x) characters must be the last
	  operands, e.g. ARCF TEST "april 1" /c/w.

	  Normally, you would only want to search "text" files for
	  strings.  Text files consist of ASCII record.  Each
	  record ends in a carriage control (CR) character.  The
	  maximum record length is 4096 bytes.	To search all
	  files, binary and text, use the /B option.  A maximum of
	  80 characters is display when text is found in a record.
|	  All control characters are changed to spaces.  If /B is
|	  used, any hi-ASCII (greater than 127) characters are
|	  blanked out.

			Option Switches
			---------------

	/B - include Binary files, i.e. files with the extensions
|	     of .EXE, .COM, .OBJ, .LIB and .BIN.
	     If omitted, only non-binary files are searched.

	/C - case sensitive search; if omitted, the search for the
	     text is made regardless of the case, i.e. upper case
	     and lower case letters are treated the same.

	/F - display the name of the file begin searched only if
	     the scan text is found within the file; if omitted,
	     the names of all files are displayed as they are
	     proccesed.

	/G - supplies any encryption (garble) password, e.g.
	     /GPSWD would supply PSWD as the password.

	/Q - suppress beeps and bells; if omitted, beeps are sent
	     with error messages.

	/S - suppress displaying the names of the files being
	     processed; this includes suppressing the display
	     of the archive file name(s), too. When used with
	     /F, the only display is of the file name that
	     contains the search text.

	/W - ignore white-space; if omitted, spaces and tabs are
	     significant.
