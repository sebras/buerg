______________________________________________________________________________


             A word or two about the Deeper Meanings of ATO
             ______________________________________________

    ATO is free of charge, but I always sort of consider this portion of the
    manual to be your "payment" (more about that later); I don't often have 
    the chance to really ramble on, so bear with me.

    ATO is six years old! I was recently going thru some old ATO information
    for version 4.08 (the hardcopy of which ran 119 pages exclusive of cross
    reference stuff) along with some correspondence from Vern on the various
    files (naturally all in squeezed and LBR format) and I realized just how
    long ATO has been around and how much fun it is. Of course back in 4.08 I
    could pretty much understand some of the inner workings whereas today I'm 
    pretty much non-functional short of stuff like this and that served to
    bring me to the point of all this and that's Vern. 

    Vern has quietly been working on ATO for six years yet I've never heard 
    him toot his own horn (by nature Vern is a retiring sort anyway and very
    modest and no doubt all this will embarrass the dickens out of him, but
    such is my privilege and the power of editorial control) and the creator of
    an incredible number of quality programs.

    Why does he do it?  Obviously he could well spend his time in financially
    rewarding pursuits (another Vern plug; GO IBMSYS and check out his
    user supported LIST program with a BRO LIST*.* in library 6 if you want a
    premier sample of Vern-O-Rama).

    Ditto Jim McKeown and the fearless ATO beta testers. Heck, they don't even 
    get a "free" version of the finished program (it's hard to give somebody a 
    free copy of a free program which opens a whole new can of worms). And I
    would be terribly remiss if I didn't mention Tom Rush and his invaluable 
    assistance with the documentation (actually I should change assistance to
    writing). Thanks Tom, it wouldn't be soup without you. 

    Well then what could the motives be?

    I think it's part of the reason why I like computers so much; never have I 
    seen an area where so many folks are willing to share and help out with no
    motive other than the pleasure of it.

    So that's our "culture" (perhaps an overused word but forgive me) and once 
    more exhibited by a reply I got very early on in my IBMNET (tho it
    wasn't known as such back then) when I expressed thanks for a problem 
    and offered to pay back the favor some day..."don't pay it back, pay it 
    forward". I like being part of that. 

    So can anything free be any good? That's for you to decide. Value is 
    subjective but don't let the lack of a price tag put you off. However if 
    you feel it's important send the money you'd otherwise spend to a charity,
    let Vern and Jim know that they do a bang-up job and "pay it forward" and
    tell somebody else about ATO.

    I'll let you off the hook and bring this to an end with the hopes that it

    hasn't been too boring for you because I've really enjoyed it. I would like
    to add one more thing however...My past "keyboardside chats" have taken
    some heat as some have taken it to be some sort of "free software for the 
    people" manifesto and that software that cost money is somehow bad. I 
    can see how that impression could be created but in reality nothing
    could be further from the truth, rather I'd ask you to use software in the 
    spirit in which it is intended, be it free, shareware or conventional
    commercial software. That being the case....Enjoy!

I.  Introduction
______________________________________________________________________________


    Don't be daunted by the size of the manual.  Effectively this manual is 
    one for a communications program, a database, a macro language and an
    editor.  Given that, it's pretty small, so hang in there.  There is a 
    strong human tendency to avoid unpleasant, time-consuming tasks, and for
    many of us, the reading of an entire manual is one of them.  Many folks
    have asked the question "I just wanna do it!  Why not leave the hard 
    stuff until later?"  That's just what we're trying to do here and 
    several "advanced topics" are in separate files.

    If you're interested we encourage you to review these files to take full 
    advantage of all of ATO's features.  For further information consult the 
    following documentation files:

    ACLS.*   -   Contains both the ACLS accounting module and
                   documentation.

    ATOADV.* -   Contains documentation for using ATO's  script  language, 
                   and  ATO's  "address  book"  processor. 

    ATOBRO.* -   ATO downloading script creator

    From time to time you may see terms used that don't make sense.  Here's a
    quick run down on some of them:
        SIG  -  "Special Interest Group" or what's now known as a forum (hey, 
                some of us are fossils!).
        PPN  -  A User ID (comes from "Project, Programmer Number")
        ATO  -  Shorthand for AUTOSIG.
        CIS  -  CompuServe Information Service.
        EMAIL - Electronic mail, Easyplex or, as of this writing CompuServe
                Mail (the name is just changing, but otherwise it's all the 
                same).

II.  How AUTOSIG Sessions Work:  Making your PC do what it does best!
______________________________________________________________________________


 A. Scanning the forums

    You turn on AUTOSIG.  With the press of a single key AUTOSIG calls CIS,
    goes to each forum you normally visit, gathers a list of all the
    messages that have been posted in the Sections (subtopics) you
    designate since your last call there; goes to CompuServe Mail, finds
    out if you have Mail, and if so downloads it; then AUTOSIG logs off
    from CIS.  You skim through the list of messages in each forum, marking
    only those whose subjects interest you.  Then you press another key and
    AUTOSIG calls CIS again, downloads the messages you have chosen, and
    logs off.

    If you prefer, you may skip gathering the list of messages, and simply
    have AUTOSIG download all the new messages in your chosen Sections. You
    can choose to have the messages read in chronological order, but it will
    usually make sense to let AUTOSIG read them in "Thread" order, following
    each message and its replies before going on to a new topic.

    You can access CIS at 300, 1200 or 2400 baud; since you are not reading
    the message online, it doesn't matter how fast they scroll by. 

    At any time you choose you can read all the messages that have been
    downloaded.  If you wish to answer one of them, a keystroke puts you
    into AUTOSIG's text editor where you can compose your reply, referring 
    back to the original message as often as you wish.  Finish your
    writing, hit a couple of keys, and your reply is stored and ready for
    transmission to CIS.  Once you have stored your reply, you will be
    returned to the reading screen to read the next message.

    The procedure is the same for Easyplex (CompuServe Mail); there's no 
    second set of commands to learn in order to read (and reply) to your
    mail.

    If you want to keep a particular message in a permanent file, a
    keystroke instructs AUTOSIG to save that message--and the permanent file
    can be called up at any time within AUTOSIG, or read by other programs
    such as LIST or a word processor.

    Finally, if you have written any messages to be posted on the forum
    message boards, one more keystroke makes AUTOSIG call CIS one more time,
    leave your messages, and log off.

______________________________________________________________________________


  B. Using the forum Data Libraries

    ATO uses the CompuServe "Quick B" error checking protocol, which for CIS
    users is superior in speed and efficiency to the other main CompuServe
    option, XMODEM.  Text files which don't require error checking can be 
    "captured" in a file instead of doing a protocol download, if you wish.

    You start AUTOSIG and choose which forum you want to visit.  A keystroke
    connects you with CIS and takes you to the forum.  There you enter the
    normal CompuServe commands to find and download the Library file of your
    choice.  If you invoke the CompuServe "B" option, a status line shows how
    the download is progressing.  When AUTOSIG notifies you that it is
    complete, you use the CIS command to log off or the ATO "Z" command.

    You can also use ATO's script language to write "auto download" scripts or 
    use the BRO "module" (ATOBRO.* in library 1 on IBMCOM) to automatically
    browse library catalogs off-line and automatically generate your download
    scripts.

 C. Accessing Other Parts of CompuServe


    AUTOSIG can be used as a simple terminal, you can use it for conferences,
    CB rap sessions, getting stock quotes, and just about anything else you
    can do on CompuServe.  You may do this manually or by the use of scripts.
    Check library 1 on IBMCOM for a script for your favorite area or for a
    function you want to automate. Chances are there's something already 
    written or only needs slight modification for your needs. If you don't 
    find one, leave a message in Section 1 of the IBMCOM forum; someone may
    have written one, or be willing to write one for you. If you write one
    yourself, don't forget to upload it to Library 0 for others to share! 

    If at any point you want to check the message board at one of your
    favorite forums, a keystroke will shift AUTOSIG into its automatic mode.
    Shifting back into terminal mode is just as easy.

 A. Setting Options


    Before you can use AUTOSIG you must adjust some of your settings on
    CompuServe, customize AUTOSIG itself for your own use, and possibly
    change some switches on your modem (either hardware switches or simple
    software commands).  Only then will ATO and CompuServe work smoothly
    together when you log in with AUTOSIG.

    Adjustments to make AUTOSIG work aren't complicated, but there are a lot 
    of them to keep track of. The following check list will help you keep
    track of what you have done and still need to do as you install AUTOSIG
    so get the pencil out and let's get cracking.

 C.  Setting Up Your Computer


    To get your equipment ready for AUTOSIG, you'll need to install the 
    AUTOSIG files, either on floppy or in an appropriate directory on your
    hard drive; check the settings in your CONFIG.SYS file or create one, and
    check--and possibly change--your modem settings.



      1. Installing the AUTOSIG Files

    The AUTOSIG program consists of the following supplied files:

              AUTOSIG.EXE     - compiled, executable program

              AUTOSIG.DOC     - this manual

              AUTOSIG.HLP     - the help file

              AUTOSIG.DEF     - sample AUTOSIG.DFN file (must be renamed or
                                copied to the active file, AUTOSIG.DFN)

    These are the names used for the current version, the one named on the
    title page.  The file names for other versions may differ.  AUTOSIG will
    create other files it needs later.

    A special tip regarding the AUTOSIG.DEF file.  If you're setting up 
    AUTOSIG for the first time, AUTOSIG will automatically create your
    definition file.  However you may wish to simply rename the AUTOSIG.DEF
    file to AUTOSIG.DFN or copy it so you will have a backup.  The supplied
    DEF file contains section names for the default forums that you would
    need to otherwise obtain while on-line.  To rename the file type the
    following from the DOS prompt:

    RENAME AUTOSIG.DEF *.DFN

    or

    COPY AUTOSIG.DEF *.DFN

III.  Getting Started - Options
______________________________________________________________________________

 C.  Setting Up Your Computer


      2. Adjusting Your CONFIG.SYS File

    Installation is complete once the AUTOSIG.EXE file has been placed on
    your disk and you have adjusted your boot disk's CONFIG.SYS file to 
    include a FILES=20 statement.  If you already have a CONFIG.SYS file,
    you can edit it with a text editor or word processor to change FILES=
    to 20.  If you have a CONFIG.SYS file that has no FILES= statement in
    it, you can simply type one in now.

    If you don't have a CONFIG.SYS file, you can create one the same way, or 
    by typing, at a DOS prompt:
           COPY CON d:CONFIG.SYS<ENTER>   (replace d with your boot drive)
           FILES=20<ENTER>
           <CTRL>Z<ENTER>

        NOTE:  If the FILES= in CONFIG.SYS is set to a number higher than 20,
        that is OK, too.  20 is the minimum number.


      3. Modem Settings

    As mentioned before, ATO comes configured for use with a Hayes AT-command
    compatible modem, as well as the capability to accept any modem commands.
    Thus, ATO is able to support many other modems.  The ATO crew has access
    to a limited number of modem types, so any tips or hints you have for
    using ATO on a certain modem would be very welcome.

    If you're using a non-Hayes modem, study your manual very carefully to 
    determine which settings correspond to the ones specified here for
    Hayes-compatibles.  In general, set your modem to return the true state
    of CD (carrier detect) and DTR (data terminal ready).

    The setting of the CD (carrier detect) and DTR (Data Terminal Ready)
    switch, either in hardware or software, is critical! If these switches
    are not set properly ATO will respond with "PC is connected" before you're 
    actually connected!  ATO will still work, but you'll never reliably know 
    whether or not you're really connected. 

    The following modem switch settings (for a Hayes SmartModem) are
    recommended:

      1 - UP        Modem disconnects when ATO is exited.
      2 - UP    V1  Modem sends result codes in English.
      3 - DOWN  Q0  Result codes are sent to the terminal.
      4 - UP    E1  Modem echoes characters while in command mode.
      5 - DOWN      Modem will not answer phone.
      6 - UP        Enables Carrier Detect sensing.

    Except for switch 6 these settings are optional.  If the settings on your
    modem are different go ahead and give it a try; chances are very good
    that it will work.

III.  Getting Started - Options
______________________________________________________________________________

 C.  Setting Up Your Computer


    If you're using a modem with "software switches" enter "terminal mode" 
    using any communications program and get the modem's attention 
    (usually with the +++ command) and send it the following string:

    AT&F&C1&D2&W

    or

    AT&D2&C1&W

    If everything "took" you should get a big OK back from your modem.

    The &F command resets your modem's profile 0 (the power-up default 
    profile) to the original factory settings.  &C1 and &D2 set the software
    switches necessary to make Data Terminal Ready (DTR) turn on and off
    when the CIS modem sends the "drop carrier" signal and the &W writes
    these settings to your modem's "permanent" profile 0 memory.  Some 
    modems have more than one profile memory; in this case you may want to
    add a 0 to the W (&W0) to be sure that the settings are written to the
    power-up default memory profile.

    If, for some reason, you need to maintain "permanent" modem settings that
    are incompatible with these, that's no problem.  Just add the commands 
    above to the MODEM DIAL COMMAND in your ATO Host setup (see instructions
    in the section on customizing your copy of ATO) and ATO will switch your
    modem over on the fly without changing your permanent setup.

    Different modems can have slightly different commands. If these switches
    aren't compatible with your modem check your documentation for setting CD 
    (carrier detect) and DTR (data terminal ready) sensing to "on" or "true".

    ATO tries to be "smart" in regards to your on or off-line state and
    depends upon these settings.

    After reading this don't be alarmed if you see the "PC is Connected" 
    message after you get the CONNECT message when you log on or when you're 
    actually logged on. At that point the message is perfectly normal.

______________________________________________________________________________

 D. Setting Options on CompuServe


    AUTOSIG expects to work with CompuServe in particular ways. In order for
    ATO to work properly, you'll have to "teach" CompuServe how to talk to 
    ATO. There are three basic areas of CIS you'll have to set up. First come 
    the Forums, where you'll have to set up a prompt character that ATO 
    can recognize and change a few other options. Next comes the Terminal
    section, where you'll tell CompuServe what sort of terminal you have, what 
    display and scrolling options you want, etc. And last, you'll set up 
    CompuServe Mail to send and receive mail for you with ATO.

    It's important that each of these options be set.  Otherwise AUTOSIG will 
    not see what it expects to see and run into problems, so it's a good idea 
    to spend some time to double check them.  The time you spend double
    checking will be more than paid back in your first AUTOSIG session.

    Until you're familar with AUTOSIG it's probably best to set these
    options manually, but after you get some experience (or it you'd like 
    to give it a go) SETUP.ARC in library 1 (AUTOSIG) of the IBMCOM forum
    contains a simple setup script that will set all your options for you.



      1. Forum Options

    To set your forum options, you'll need to go online to CompuServe with a 
    communications program other than ATO (of course, once you've got ATO 
    going, you can use it to make later changes in your options.)

    Once you're on-line, you'll need to visit each of the forums you're 
    planning to include in your AUTOSIG setup. If you're using MENU mode now, 
    follow the menu choice to make changes in your options. If you're already 
    in COMMAND mode, just type OP at the first Forum! prompt. Either way, you
    will be facing a menu of choices like the following:

             Forum OPTIONS                     You change these:
              1 INITIAL menu/prompt [Forum]     (CRITICAL)
              2 Forum MODE [COMMAND]            (CRITICAL)
              3 PAUSE after messages [Always]
              4 NAME [Your Name]
              5 Prompt CHARACTER [ ]            (The ATO default is ^G)
              6 EDITOR [LINEDIT]                (OPTIONAL)
              7 SECTIONS [...]
              8 HIGH msg read [N]
              9 REPLIES info [Count]
             10 TYPE waiting msgs [NO]          (CRITICAL)
             11 SKIP msgs you left [NO]

         Enter choice!


    A few of these choices are critical for ATO: You have to set the Initial
    Menu/Prompt to Forum (#1), you must choose COMMAND MODE

III.  Getting Started - Options
______________________________________________________________________________

 D. Setting Options on CompuServe

    (#2), you'll need to set a prompt character (#5), and you must answer 
    N for Type Waiting Messages (#10).

    The default Prompt Character for ATO is ^G (Control-G) - the bell.
    (To enter Control G, use Shift-6 for the ^ rather than the control key).
    You will not hear the bell while AUTOSIG is running, but will if you
    access the CIS forums using other communications programs, unless they can
    be set to "filter" a "7" (BEL) to "0" (NUL).

    You may use another character if you like, but if you do, you will have to
    change ATO accordingly by changing your PC Options setting or using a
    start-up command switch. These features are explained later. Personally I
    prefer ^B, but that is a matter of preference. Please DO NOT use ^A as
    it is used internally by ATO.

    OPTIONAL: More than likely you use the LINEDIT option, the editor with
    the line numbers. You may continue to use this editor with ATO, it will
    work fine. You may want to change to EDIT, the editor without line
    numbers.  If you do, your message uploads will be faster, but you might
    find that EDIT is a little harder to use if you leave messages in "real 
    time". Like many options in Autosig, this area is as flexible as possible. 

    To exit the OPtion area hit a carriage return to exit the area and when
    prompted enter a P to make the changes permanent.

    * REMEMBER: You MUST make these changes in each forum where you'll be 
    *           using AUTOSIG!


    * ATOTIP - These changes will put you in command mode and you may
        want to use the forum outside of ATO from time to time but will feel
        uncomfortable without menus. No problem! While I encourage you to
        eliminate menus (as they can waste a lot of time) you can send the
        command OP;UM YES;S (OPtion, Use Menus Yes, Session only) at the top
        forum prompt to enable menus. Since this setting is only for your
        session, command mode will be restored for the next time you use ATO.

______________________________________________________________________________

 D. Setting Options on CompuServe


      2. Terminal Options

    You must also make sure that CompuServe's settings for your terminal are 
    set so that ATO will work properly.

    Actually, CompuServe maintains different configurations for your user ID
    at 300 baud, 1200 baud, and 2400 baud.  You must log onto CIS at each
    transmission speed to change the settings for that speed.  You will
    probably want to use AUTOSIG at 300 baud for conferences, CB, and other
    services that require you to stay online to use them (300 baud is
    generally fast enough to keep up with the pace of online discussion, and
    is much cheaper in such a format), and at your highest modem speed
    (usually 1200 or 2400, depending on your hardware) when downloading or
    uploading messages or Library files.

    Go online with your communications program and from any !
    prompt, enter GO TERMINAL.

    1) Select menu item 2, "Change Permanent settings"

    2) Select menu item 2, "Logon/Service Options"
        Set CompuServe Mail waiting to NOTIFY ONLY
        Personal menu established to NO

    3) Hit a carriage return to exit.

    4) Select "Display Options"
        Set "Paged Display" to NO
        Set all others to YES

    5) Hit a carriage return to exit

    6) Select "Make session settings permanent".
        Reply YES that you want to make the changes permanent.

    7) Hit a carriage return to exit

    Believe me, it's not as complicated as it looks. 


  E. CompuServe Mail/Easyplex Settings

    While you're on-line, you should set yourself up in CompuServe Mail, even if 
    you don't currently use it. 

    GO MAIL to get there and select menu option #5, "Address Book", then
    entry #5, "Enter/Change your NAME".  That's it.

 A. THE PRIMARY MENU


    Now that you've set up your equipment and your CompuServe options, the 
    next step is to set up ATO for your own use. There are three parts to this
    operation: setting up your Forums, setting your communications options
    (Hosts) and setting up your PC Options (color, printer, mouse options,
    etc.)

    To get started, you'll need to start ATO for the first time. Place your 
    ATO disk in Drive A or go to the hard disk subdirectory where ATO is, and,
    at the DOS prompt, type      AUTOSIG <ENTER>

    DOS now loads the program and begins its execution.  You should be
    presented with the ATO Primary Menu (Figure 1).  If nothing is displayed,
    your computer may not be compatible with the way the IBM PC manages the
    monitor display.  You should then press the F10 key to tell ATO to
    terminate and return to the DOS.  At the DOS prompt, add the characters
    /T.  This tells ATO to use a different method of writing to your monitor.
                                 AUTOSIG /T <ENTER>

IV.  Customizing Your Copy of AUTOSIG
______________________________________________________________________________

 A. THE PRIMARY MENU


      1. Organization of the Primary Menu

    The Primary Menu screen contains the Host Selection menu, the Item
    Selection menu, and the Forum Selection List.  Refer to Figure 1.

    The Host Selection menu offers a choice of CompuServe services to call.

    The Forum Selection List offers a choice of Forums to access.

    The Item Selection menu selects the operation to perform.


    For the first use of ATO, you must:

        - edit the Host entries (press a number key) to supply your user id,
          password, the CIS phone number, and other service items.

        - edit the Forum entries (press a letter key) to identify the
          forum(s) that you wish to access.

        - edit the PC Options entries (press F10) to set colors, printer
          lines, mouse, beeper, etc.



      2. Moving Around the Menu

    You tell ATO what to do next by pressing a key, or by moving a mouse
    cursor to the appropriate field and clicking the left button:

        - Fn (function) keys perform the operations described in the Item
          Selection menu

        - <enter> has two meanings.  If the bar on the Item Selection menu is
          at the top, its normal position, <enter> takes you immediately to
          the Forum Menu page for the forum whose letter on the Forum
          Selection List is currently selected.  If you use <Tab> or <Shift-
          Tab> to move the Item Selection bar to another action on the Item
          Selection List, <enter> will perform that action.

        - TAB moves the Item Selection bar to the next item
        - shift-TAB moves the Item Selection bar to the previous item

        - alt-N resets all High Message Numbers to N<ew>

        - PgDn or PgUp selects the next or previous Forum in the list and

B. THE PC OPTIONS MENU

    ATO comes with a pre-defined set of these PC Options.  Unless you're 
    using a mouse or are having compatibility problems, you really won't NEED 
    to change any of these.  You're probably close to info overload as it is. 

    However, you may want to change some of these later, or may need to
    juggle them because of a compatibility problem, so keep this menu in
    mind.


      1. Choosing PC Options

    "Normal Color f,b" - This allows you to set the colors to be used for the
        "f" foreground and "b" background for non-highlighted areas.  Refer
        to Appendix F for a list of valid numbers. Note: 7,0 may provide a
        better display on a monochrome monitor.

    "Hilite Color f,b" - This setting allows you to set the color to be used
        for highlighted messages and fields. Refer to Appendix F for a
        list of valid color codes. 15,0 may be best for monochrome. The new
        color settings take effect when you exit the PC Options menu and
        return to the Primary menu.

    "Printer lines" - indicates how many lines per page AUTOSIG will use
        when printing.

    "/H Skip Retrace" - Disables testing of the monitor's retrace.  This 
        results in faster displays, but may cause flicker on some monitors.
        This options does not apply to the use of monochrome monitors.

    "/K Keep Mail" - Y tells CIS to keep (SAVE) CompuServe Mail messages
        online in your on-line Mail area area, N to DELETE them as soon as
        it has downloaded them.  This affects ONLY online save or delete.

    "/M Skip RM" - Used to suppress automatic Read Marked function.  This
        will keep ATO happy in Auto mode.  You can still have automatic RM
        functions in Auto mode by using the Y function in ATO, so only turn
        this on if you never plan to use Auto mode.

    "/C CLS each message" - Enter Y to clear the screen when it fills, thus
        preventing scrolling.  Useful if your color monitor flickers while
        lines roll on and off the screen.

    "/B Disable kybd" - A Y locks the keyboard during auto functions.  This
        allows you to supply ATO console input through a batch file system or
        use a utility such as KEYFAKE or KEYIN to control ATO.

    "/F Printer FF" - Use Y to eliminate most form feeds that are issued when
        you P>rint forum messages.  Your messages will be printed continuously
        with form feeds issued only as the printer nears the perforation or
        end of the page.  If you issue a LF or FF directly to your printer,
        ATO's line counter will get out of sync.

______________________________________________________________________________

B. THE PC OPTIONS MENU

    "/S Sort QS hdrs" - Use Y to instruct ATO to automatically sort the
        QuickScan headers by topic whever the M>ark command is used. Note
        that if you do not use this option, you can still sort the headers
        by explicit commands while in the M>ark function, if you want to.

    "/T Slow screen" - Use Y to eliminate writing directly to the monitor's 
        video display buffer.  If you're using a clone, and your screen 
        blanks unexpectedly, try this switch.

        ATO is compatible with DesqView, Double DOS, and APX Core.  You need
        not use /T unless you have problems, i.e. blank or missing displays.

    "/Q Quiet beeper" - Use Y to suppress most of the beeps and bells.

    "/U Supress ^U" - Enter a Y to stop ATO from sending a ^U before it
        sends a command. Generally you need to leave this set to N unless
        you're using a network that cannot accept, or which otherwise uses 
        a ^U for it's own purposes. 

    "/G Prompt char - As already explained, the prompt character that 
        AUTOSIG normally recognizes is ^G, a bell control character. If you
        want to use another prompt character enter the new one here, but do
        be sure to set your forum options to reflect the change!



      2. Using Command Line Switches for PC Options

    The "slash" options described above can be specified when you load the
    AUTOSIG.EXE program by adding a space, "/", and a letter (upper or lower
    case) to specify the option:

        AUTOSIG /T /B /C

    In effect, this command sets the /T, /B, and /C options to Y, overriding
    whatever you have set within AUTOSIG using the Edit Options menu.  There
    are other option "switches".  They are described in Appendix B.

 C. THE HOST CONFIGURATION OPTIONS MENU



      1. Setting Up to Call CompuServe

    AUTOSIG will automatically log onto CIS, but only if it has certain
    information which only you can provide:  the phone number to dial,
    your user id, your password, and your BAUD rate.  To set these and other
    options important for logging on select the appropriate host entry via a
    number and then hit F4 -Edit Host Options- from the Item Selection menu.
    This will call up the Host Configuration Options menu (figure 3).  (The
    word "host" refers to the computer system that you want ATO to access via
    the telephone--in this case, CompuServe.  It is also often used here to
    refer to a particular configuration that you have set up here.)

 C. THE HOST CONFIGURATION OPTIONS MENU


     2. Host Configuration Options

    Even if you never call any other service than CIS, it's often convenient 
    to have several different host entries, as in the example:  one for each
    BAUD rate you expect to use, and one for each node (telephone number)
    you may want to call.

    "Host name" - identifies the system that you are calling.  Enter a one to
        17 character name of your choice, including blanks, commas, or any
        other characters.  The Host names in the example indicate the BAUD
        rate.

    "CIS phone number" - enter your local CIS or net telephone number. If you
        access CIS through TYMNET, prefix the number with a T, e.g.
        T555-1212.  If you use TELENET, prefix the number with the letter G,
        e.g.  G555-1212.  If the phone number is too long to fit in this
        field, place the first part of it at the end of the Modem Commands
        field.  ATO sends both fields to the modem when dialing.

    "Your userid " - enter your CIS numbers separated by a comma, e.g.
        70000,0000.

    "Your password " - enter your CIS password.  (Special note:  remember
        that your password will now be on your diskette or hard disk and
        remember to keep it secure.  Though it may be a hassle, do change
        your password on CIS periodically and go through the routine of
        changing it in your configuration file; it's worth the extra time and 
        trouble.)

    "Tymnet address " - if you are using Tymnet to access CIS, you may enter
        the host name here.  If omitted, the default is CIS02.

    "Logon SCRipt file" - Enter the name of any external script file that
        should be executed at logon.  The script file is not executed until
        you are logged on to CIS.  See the ATOADV.ARC file for more
        information on scripts.

    "Userid prompt" - No need to change this, unless CIS changes its logon
        prompt (doubtful).

    "Password prompt" - See comment on "Userid prompt."

    "What baud rate" - Enter the modem speed to be used, normally a value of
        300, 1200 or 2400.  Other speeds such as 450 baud may be specified,
        but will work only if your CIS node supports them.  ATO will not
        change the baud rate while you are connected.  You must log off to
        change the baud rate. If you wish to run the port at a high rate,
        ATO will run the port up to 19,200 baud.

    "Modem dial commands" - The default commands are for the Hayes modem and
        should be retained--unless, of course, your modem is not Hayes-

 C. THE HOST CONFIGURATION OPTIONS MENU

        compatible, in which case enter the appropriate commands here.  This
        field may also be used to extend the telephone number.  The default
        contains "M0"; if you want to hear the handshaking between ATO and CIS,
        delete these two characters, or change them to "M1".  If you have
        trouble calling in change the dial string to ATDT (my personal
        preference).  You may also include in the modem dial commands any
        necessary setup commands that you did not want to make permanent in
        your modem setup when you first installed ATO.

    "COMmunications port" - enter either COM1:  or COM2:  to specify which
        Asynchronous Communications Adapter (port) is to be used.  The colon
        is optional. COM1: and COM2: are fairly standard, but ATO defines thru
        COM8: (COMN: is just a "name" to ATO). If you have problems with ATO
        talking to your modem see appendix C for a list of comm addresses and
        IRQ's associated with each COMn: "name". 

    "Modem Connect text" - tells ATO what your modem sends when the phone is
        connected.  The default is "CONNECT".

    "Modem Disconnect text" - tells ATO what your modem sends when the phone
        becomes disconnected.  The default is "NO CARRIER".  ATO also checks
        for "BUSY" and "NO DIALTONE".  The special character ~ (tilde, or
        squiggle) may be used to have ATO pause one second, a } (right curly
        brace) to send a carriage return, and a ^ (caret, or the shifted 6
        key) to indicate a control character such as ^D.

    "Modem Hang-up command" - tells ATO what to send to the modem to
        disconnect the phone.  The default for a Hayes-compatible modem is
        ATH.

    "Modem Reset command" - tells ATO what to send to the modem to reset it.
        The default for a Hayes-compatible modem is "~+++~ATZ", which results
        in a one-second pause, sending three plus sign characters, another
        one-second pause, and then the command ATZ. If your modem uses the
        later Hayes extended software switches (&), you might choose
        "~+++~AT&C1&D2&WZ" to enable tracking of carrier presence by Data
        Terminal Ready.

    "Host 1st ready prompt" - tells ATO what the Host will send when it is
        ready for your requests.  The default is "CompuServe" or "Executive".

    "Forum function prompt" - is used to tell ATO what prompt you see when
        you arrive in a forum. If you have your options set to immediately
        log you into the message section, change the prompt to "Messages !".
        For Auto use, this MUST be "Forum !" (the default). NOTE CAREFULLY
        that there is a space between "Forum" and "!", and that the word
        "Forum" has a capital "F" and remaining lower case letters. The
        same rules apply to "Messages !" as what appears in this field
        must match what CIS sends as a prompt.

    "Bulletin file name" - If you want ATO to save all CIS logon messages
        until the first Forum command is sent, enter a filename here, such as

 C. THE HOST CONFIGURATION OPTIONS MENU

        AUTOSIG.BUL, for ATO to use.  Otherwise the bulletins will not be
        saved.  Include the drive and path with the filename if the file is
        not to be kept in AUTOSIG's own disk or directory. 

    "HOST connect response" - This is the code you send CompuServe to tell it
        you're ready to go.  Normally a ^C is what you'll want to use.  In
        the case of 2400 baud MNP nodes you'll want to use the tilde to delay 
        sending the ^C.  The following entry should be adequate:

        ~~~~~~~^C

        This allows 7 seconds for MNP handshaking after the CONNECT message
        before the sending of the ^C.

    "File transfer d:\path" - If you want file downloads to go somewhere
        other than the default drive or sub-directory, enter the path for
        downloads, followed by a trailing backslash. The following
        would cause all downloads to go to a sub-directory on drive C: called
        DOWNLOAD:

 D. THE FORUM CONFIGURATIONS OPTION MENU


    The Forum Selection List comes preset with several predefined, standard
    forum entries.  None of them is required, but if you intend to access
    CompuServe Mail, you MUST have an entry containing the word
    "mail," such as, well, MAIL.

    Adding your favorite forums to the Forum Selection List, or deleting those
    already there, or otherwise changing the presets, will be explained below.

    To add a forum to the Forum Selection List, so that you can access it
    automatically using AUTOSIG, choose Item F5, "Add a New Forum."  AUTOSIG
    will take you to the Forum Configuration Options menu (Figure 4) for the
    next unused letter in the list--in this example, I.

______________________________________________________________________________

 D. THE FORUM CONFIGURATIONS OPTION MENU

    The menu provides a list of options for you to specify.  Several of them
    have already been filled from entries in the previous Forum on the
    Selection List.  Change those that are incorrect--for example, the forum
    name and "GO to page"--or that don't reflect what you want AUTOSIG to do. 

    "SIGname" - this is the name you will give to the Forum (SIG).  Enter a
        name of up to SEVEN characters.  This name is displayed on the
        Function Menu.  Since this name is used to create files, be sure that
        it contains valid DOS filename characters.  That is, do not use *
        (asterisk), ?  (question mark), or . (period).  If the name you give
        is too long, ATO will truncate it after the 7th character.

    "GO to page" - enter the forum "page number" or, even better, the "quick 
        reference word," e.g.  IBMCOM.  You may also include a gateway name, 
        with the syntax gate:forumname, e.g. PCM:UTILFORUM.

        Appendix A provides a list of forum names and their quick reference
        words.  For the most current list, GO INDEX on CIS and capture it as
        an ASCII file.

    "Hostname override" - if you want access to a Forum to be made through
        one particular Host, then supply the name of that Host here.  For
        example, a Host called "CONFERENCE" may be useful for defining a 300
        baud Host for CB or conferences.

    "Files drive:\path" - tells ATO which drive and directory to use for
        access to its files.  If left blank, ATO will use the current
        directory on the current drive.  You may supply a drive and/or path
        name--for example, C:\ATO. If the drive and/or path are not valid,
        this field is set to "*** INVALID ***".

        Exceptions:  The AUTOSIG.DFN file and the log (AUTOSIG.mth) files
        must be in the same subdirectory as AUTOSIG itself.  All other files
        may be accessed from the drive and path named here.

    "Starting msg # or N" - normally N is used initially so that all New
        messages are processed. After you have used ATO to download
        messages or headers, ATO will show the last message number read
        here. When you go on-line again, ATO will use this number in
        place of the CIS High Message Number (HMN) for the Q, H, F, T
        functions. If you want to reset this to N and let CIS use its HMN,
        you can just enter the Alt-N command at the Forum Function Menu.

        If you want to review all messages available in the forum, you can
        reset this field to 0.

    "Append message file" - Enter an N to erase the current message file and
        create a new one whenever messages are downloaded.  Enter a Y to
        accumulate messages in the current message file.  (An alternative way
        to accumulate messages in a file is to S>ave them as you read them
        within AUTOSIG.)  If you do enter "Y", be sure to watch free disk
        space carefully, and edit message files with your editor or word

 D. THE FORUM CONFIGURATIONS OPTION MENU

        processor (or erase them using AUTOSIG's K>ill command) when space 
        gets short.

    "Log sessions" - Enter a Y to record on-line time in a log file. The
        log file name is AUTOSIG.mmm, where 'mmm' is an abbreviation for
        the current month. Enter an N to disable logging. The log file
        contents are used by ACLS for accounting purposes if you wish to
        use it.

    "Stay connected" - Enter a Y if you wish to remain connected after a
        message upload/download session.  If you want to visit other areas of
        the forum for downloading or whatever during the current call this
        option should be set to Y. Enter an N to disconnect from CIS after
        exiting this particular forum.  (The "AUTO" option keeps you connected
        until you have visited all the specified forums, regardless of how you
        have set this option.)

    "Send forum ^P" - Enter a Y to instruct ATO to send a ^P immediately
        after a GO page command. This suppresses all CIS messages before
        the Forum !  prompt. This mode is NOT recommended
        simply for the reason that you may miss important information in
        the forum "news flash".

    "Sections (# or ALL)" - Leave this blank if you intend to access all
        Forum setions (subtopics), or if you prefer to use the CIS OPtion
        command to manage your sections (subtopics).  Otherwise, enter a list
        of subtopic numbers (form:  n,n,n where n is any section number).  ATO
        will only access messages from those sections.

        You may wish to leave the default "ALL" setting for now. When you are
        online with ATO in Terminal Mode, you may use ALT-G to "gather" a list
        of the sections in each forum; you can then see that list by pressing
        ALT-N in the Forum Configuration Options Menu.

    "PPN file name" - If you wish to  use the AUTOSIG ppn (user id) directory
        facility enter the filename that should be used to store user ids and
        names.

    "ATO file exe [.ATO]" - normally, the file extension for all files is .ATO;
        you may use another extension by specifying it here, or on the command
        line with the /Lext option, e.g. /LBAK to use .BAK as the ATO file
        extension.

    When all the Forum Configuration Options are set, they are saved by using
    the F10 key, and the new forum is added to the Forum Selection List.

    When you have finished configuring AUTOSIG they will be saved in your
    AUTOSIG.DFN file. The DFN file should be on the same disk and in the
    same directory as AUTOSIG.EXE.

    Now you're ready for the next step--going on-line with AUTOSIG!

    Okay, lots of work so far and no fun.  Now that the Host and Forum
    configurations are complete and correct let's go online and 
    access a forum.

    Select the Forum you want to visit from the Forum Selection List.  When
    you do so, you will see the Forum Function Menu (figure 5).  This lays out
    all the things AUTOSIG can do for you, and the keystroke commands to give.

    a reminder of what Forum you will be accessing, and what Host you will be
    dialing to access it.  You can change the Host from this menu by using
    the up and down arrow keys; and if you've called up the menu for the 
    wrong Forum, you can find the right one using the PgUp and PgDn keys or
    the Left/Right cursor keys.

    AUTOSIG functions that can be performed on-line on CIS are listed on the
    left; those you do before or after a CIS access are on the right.

 A. Function Menu Commands



      (B) Beep on/off toggle

    This toggles the BEEP that ATO sends when a session sequence or error has
    occurred.  The default is BEEP on.


      (C) Reconfigure

    Press C to switch to the Main menu. This is, among other things, a quick
    way to select another forum.


      (1) AUTOmatic first pass


      (2) AUTOmatic second pass

    Invokes AUTO routines to access several SIGs automatically in one CIS
    session--discussed in detail elsewhere in this manual.


      (E) Shell to new copy of COMMAND

    Invokes DOS so that you may run other programs or enter DOS commands.  ATO
    remains active and in memory, but the communications line is suspended.
    To return to ATO, enter the EXIT command to DOS.


      (G) Go online, terminal mode.

    Press G when you want to use AUTOSIG as a simple terminal program, for
    example when downloading from or uploading to a forum Library.  ATO will
    dial CIS and log on, and then leave you to issue your own commands.  See
    below for details about the function-key and alt-key commands available
    in this mode.  To leave terminal mode and use AUTOSIG's automatic 
    functions, enter ctrl-D or ctrl-X.


      (K) Delete file

    Use this option to erase/delete the message (M), save (S) file, header (H)
    file, bulletin (B), or reply (R) file for the current Forum.  You are asked
    to confirm the request and may respond with an N if you change your mind.


      (L) List bulletins

    If you have supplied a bulletin file name in the Host Configuration menu,
    press L to read any bulletins stored in it. As you read the bulletins,
    press enter to read the next page; any other key will exit the bulletin

 A. Function Menu Commands

    file and return you to the menu.



      (N) Update DFN file.

    This function writes all ATO information to the DFN file.  This is
    normally done when ATO is properly exited, but you can use it whenever you
    want to be sure, for whatever reason, that the DFN file has been updated.



      (O) Change Forum Options

    Press O to switch to the Forum Configuration menu, where you can change
    the settings for the current forum (or, by using the PgUp and PgDn keys,
    for any other forum). Pressing <F3> will have the same effect.



      (P) Preview Leave/Reply file.

    Press P to "preview" the replies and original messages you have already
    written, so that you can revise or delete any of them if you wish before
    leaving them in the forum.  ATO loads [forumname]L.ATO file in the message
    editor and presents the messages to you one by one.  When you have
    disposed of the last message, AUTOSIG rewrites the [forumname]L.ATO file
    to include your changes.

    You may use the preview function on a reply to change the privacy of
    the message and to change whether you want CIS to "reformat" the
    message (change the end-of-line word wrap, tabular format, etc.)

    You may also use the preview function to change the message from a
    reply to a new message (which also starts a new thread). If you send a
    new message, you can also use preview to change the message section
    within the forum and the addressee's name and ppn. 



      (S) Send new messages online.

    Press S to send the original messages and replies in [forumname]L.ATO to
    the forum.

    AUTOSIG provides insurance in case you have replied to a message that has
    been deleted before you got back online.  If the forum software can't 
    find the original message, your reply will be left as if it was an
    original message to the same addressee and with the same subject.

    Once the messages are successfully POSTed, ATO erases the file.

______________________________________________________________________________

 A. Function Menu Commands


      (V) View SAVEd messages.

    If you have saved individual messages while reading them using the S>ave
    command, you can view them from within AUTOSIG by pressing V.


      (W) Write new messages offline

    In addition to replies, new messages can be prepared offline.  Press W
    and you are placed in the Message Editor--discussed later on--and asked
    to name the addressee and supply a subject description.


      (X) Exit to system

    When you have finished an AUTOSIG session, and when you have logged off
    from CIS, press X to leave AUTOSIG and return to the DOS prompt.  If you
    are still connected when you press X, you will see this message at the
    bottom of the screen:

    "Exiting to DOS without logging off.  OK?  (y/N)"

    Hit enter to return to the forum menu where you can then use the Z (send
    OFF and disconnect) command, or, if you really want to exit ATO while
    connected, reply with a 'Y'.


      (Z) Send OFF and disconnect

    This command allows you to send the OFF command to CIS and "hang up" the
    phone.  Use this option if you are finished with a CIS access, have the
    Forum Function menu on screen, and see the "PC IS CONNECTED" message at
    the bottom of the menu.  There is a pause of about four seconds after
    disconnection so that you may see any final messages, such as your connect
    time, followed by the prompt "[Disconnect detected]".  Press ENTER to
    return to the Function Menu.

V. Going On-Line with AUTOSIG
______________________________________________________________________________

 B. Online Download Functions


    The most commonly used methods for reading sequences of CIS forum messages
    are available on this menu.  Certain others, like RI (Read Individual
    msg#) and RS (Read Search), are available only in terminal mode.



      (D) Download marked messages

    If you have downloaded message headers, and then have gone offline to mark
    messages to be downloaded, the (D) command is used to go online and issue
    the CIS commands download them.  Of course, you may stay online and mark
    messages, and then download them.

    AUTOSIG sends a RT # ONLY (if the headers reflect threads) or RI # (if the
    headers indicate individual messages) command to CIS.  The downloaded
    messages are captured in a file named [forumname]M.ATO - M for messages -
    that can be read and replied to within AUTOSIG.  This function is
    automatically part of AUTO /2 whenever AUTOSIG finds a file of marked
    headers.



      (F) Read Forward

    Downloads all messages in message number order by using the CIS forum
    software Read Forward command.  The messages are read beginning with
    the High Message Number specified in the Forum configuration option.
    AUTOSIG will update this number each time you use this function.



      (Q) Quick Scan

    Downloads message headers using the CIS Quick Scan command.  Each message
    header represents one or several messages in a thread, and includes the
    message number (for the first in the current thread), subject, subtopic,
    and number of replies only.

    When all of the message headers have been downloaded, ATO returns to the
    Forum Function Menu, where you can use the (M)ark function (see below) to
    select the messages you want to download and read.



      (H) Scan Headers in message order

    is similar to Q, except that the message headers are downloaded in message
    number order using CIS's Scan Forward command, and each represents only 
    one message each.  These headers include the From, To, and Date fields in
    addition to those that are included when you quick scan.

V. Going On-Line with AUTOSIG
______________________________________________________________________________

 B. Online Download Functions



      (J) Scan headers in thread order

    J is similar to H except that headers are downloaded in thread order
    rather than in numerical order.



      (T) Read Thread

    Downloads all messages in thread order starting with the high message
    number (or N) that you supplied in the Forum Configuration menu. This
    function also updates the High Message Number in your configuration.



      (U) Download marked messages to you

    is the equivalent of CIS's Read Marked from the Forum ! prompt.  It 
    will read all new messages on the forum that are addressed to you.



      (I) Download messages you sent

    Downloads messages that you have sent by using the Read Select command
    with your ppn.



      (Y) Download all messages to you

    Downloads all the messages addressed to your ppn that are still on the
    message board, using the Read Search command and specifying your user id
        in the "To:"  field.

    U, I, and Y are useful for a quick check to see if a message you left has
    been read by the addressee or had any replies, or to delete messages to or
    from you that have served their purpose and have no general interest (or
    are private and therefore inaccessible to other forum members).  They are
    otherwise not a very efficient way to use the Forums or AUTOSIG.

 C. Intervening in an AUTOSIG session


    During automatic operation, any keyboard input (except ESCape) is sent to
    CIS.  Thus, if an error occurs, you can type in the correct command or
    response.  Often, when CIS responds to your typed command, AUTOSIG will
    pick up its automatic routine and carry it through.

    If you wish to stop automatic processing, for example if problems develop
    that don't stop AUTOSIG by themselves, hit the ESCape key TWICE to enter 
    Terminal Mode and regain control.

    Pressing ESCape ONCE during an AUTO /1 or /2 operation will cause AUTOSIG
    to stay connected at the end of the operation. This is useful if you are
    not set to STAY CONNECTED and you change your mind as AUTO is running.

 E. Offline Message Processing


    After you have used AUTOSIG to go online, you may find that each Forum
    menu has one or more of the Offline Message Processing options
    highlighted. That indicates that there is an ATO file which you can read
    or otherwise process by pressing that letter.

    Also, at the bottom of the menu a "suggestion" letter will appear in the
    blank above "Select a function."  Normally, the letter is the one you
    would press anyway to perform the next logical step in dealing with forum
    messages; for instance, if you've just finished using the D command to 
    download messages, the letter R (for Read) will not only be highlighted
    in the menu but will appear at the bottom, where it can be selected by
    hitting the enter key.

    The various menu items are discussed here in the sequence in which you are
    most likely to use them.



      (M) Scan and mark messages offline

    This step normally follows the downloading of message headers done by the
    ATO Q scanning command.  Press M and AUTOSIG will list the headers one
    screenfull at a time, as in Figure 6:

    Use the up/down cursor control keys to select messages to be marked.  The
    PgDn key displays the next screenfull; PgUp displays the previous
    screenfull;

    HOME positions to the top line on the current screen; END positions to the
    last entry on the screen.

    Press M to mark a message to be downloaded.  Press any other key to unmark
    a message so that it will not be downloaded.

    You may S>ort the headers by section number at any time while you are
    marking them.  Once the headers have sorted, they cannot be sorted again.
    The sort effects the order that the messages are downloaded.  That is,
    unsorted headers result in messages being downloaded in chronological
    order, while sorted headers produce messages in section number order.

    When the last screenfull of message headers is displayed, the top line of
    the screen includes the word BOTTOM:

           Marking messages:  28 headers; HMN= 28580        BOTTOM   6-28

    The menu at the bottom of the screen offers two ways to leave the Mark
    function.  Press F10 and your markings will be recorded for use by ATO for
    downloading messages.  The header file is deleted.  The Esc key aborts the
    function, discards your marks, and retains the header file.

    * IMPORTANT!  The F10 function deletes the header file so all
    * desired headers must be marked in one "session". If you mark some, exit
    * and then return for further marking the file will no longer exist.

    If you have elected to use the H or J command the following display is
    presented:

                   Msg# xxxxxx S3/Video/EGA (H)
                        30-Feb-89  23:52:29

                    M>ark one, T>hread, Q>uit, or Enter for Next

    You may M>ark the message to download the single message, use the
    T>hread command to download the entire thread, Q>uit, or hit the
    enter key to continue.

    When you have completed marking the message headers, download the actual
    messages by pressing D. If you use an AUTO /2 pass, this will take place
    automatically whenever ATO finds a file of headers you have marked. The
    downloaded messages are captured in a file named [forumname]M.ATO--M for
    messages--that can be read and replied to within AUTOSIG.

      (R) Read and reply offline

    Press R and the messages in [forumname]M.ATO will be displayed, one at a
    time, for you to read and, if you wish, to answer.  If a message is too
    long to fit on a screen, a "more" prompt will appear in the lower right
    hand side of the screen.  Hitting the Return key will display the rest of
    the message; alternately, the cursor down/up keys will scroll the
    message forward and backward on the screen.

    You have two options in the display of messages. The default is the
    "classic" format which is identical to the on-line format. If you invoke
    ATO with the /N switch on the command line the message header is
    reformatted into two lines to allow more space for text. Try both and
    select the method that works best for you.


    Here is how to navigate through the sequence of messages:

          <enter>      to display the next screen
          <PgDn>       to skip to the next message
          <PgUp>       to display the previous message
          <HOME>       to display the first message
          <END>        to display the last message
          <Up Arrow>   move the message up one line
          <Down Arrow> move the message down one line
          <X>          to skip out of the current thread and go to the next


    The following option list is displayed at the end of each message:

  __________________________________________________________________________

  F10 terminates the (R)ead function and returns you to the Forum Function
       Menu.

  B>ack displays the message immediately before the current message.
       Multiple messages can be displayed by issuing the B>ack command
       several times.

  T>op returns you to the top of the message file, displaying the message
       in the file. You may also use the HOME key for this purpose.

  E>nd is the opposite of T>op, taking you to the last message in the file.
       You may also use the END key.

  A>gain redisplays the same message--useful when you are reading the second
       page of a long message and want to get back to page 1.

  L>ocate finds a string in the current message file. The L>ocate function
       searches (forward only) throughout the whole file, not simply within
       the particular message shown on screen. When asked to enter the text
       string to be located, you may type up to 128 characters including
       blanks, commas, or any other special characters.  The search is
       case-sensitive; that is, you must match the capitalization of the
       text you are searching for.

  ^ (caret) locates a string just like L)ocate, but scans the message file
       in the reverse direction; F3 locates the next occurance of the
       text later in the file, and F9 locates the precious occurance
       earlier in the file.

  N>ext repeats the L>ocate search until the end of the file is reached.

  M>ail is like the R>eply command (see below) except that the reply is
       mailed via CompuServe Mail. AUTOSIG issues a MAIL command instead of
       the POST command.

  H>dr causes a printer formfeed and prints the current message to the
       printer. This is handy when you want a single message on hardcopy
       as in comparison to the P>rint command.

  P>rint copies the current message to the printer.  A title line is printed
       at the top of the first page, giving the name of the forum and the
       current time and date.  The system printer, LPT1, is used.  ATO will
       send a form feed when it thinks that a printer page is full.  Use
       ATO's PC Options menu to specify how many lines per page to print. 

  S>ave appends the current message to a file named [SIGname]S.ATO for
       archiving.

       There are three ways to reply to a message, indicated by the
       Re/Ua/Join series of commands:

  R>eply addresses your new message to the sender of the original, using the

 E. Offline Message Processing

       R>eply name and PPN as they appear there, and also uses the original
       message's subject description.  This continues the thread to which 
       the original message belongs. More detail in the Editor section.

  U>A  uses the ppn of the sender of the original message, but lets you
       supply a new subject description.  This begins a new thread.

  J>oin lets you send a message to the addressee of the message you're 
       reading; it lets you "join" the conversation in a different way than
       by replying.  Join lets you supply a new subject description.

      If you choose to reply using any of these options, you are placed in
      the Message Editor--discussed in detail later in this manual.

      Upon completing your reply, it is stored in the [forumname]L.ATO file
      to be sent ("left") when you go online, and the next message is
      automatically presented for you to read.

  D>el  Pressing this key while reading lets you delete a message to you or
        from you on the next AUTO pass through the forum.

    Not all commands are available for every message.  For example, the
    D>elete command is offered only for messages you wrote or that were
    addressed to you.

    This is a lot of information, but don't worry, just hit F1 at the message 
    read screen and use the help screen until you get the hang of it or to jog
    your memory for those little used functions.

    Special Note!

    A note not related to ATO but on general forum "procedure".  It's a good 
    idea to leave a message addressed to you posted so that others may benefit
    from it.  It is particularly a problem if you've posted a question and 
    delete all replies.  Others will see that you didn't get a reply and it 
    generally turns into a wheel spinning contest.

    It is considered good form to delete messages that wouldn't be of interest 
    to others.  This would include simple 'thanks' type messages and
    especially private messages. For this reason private messages display the
    first header line of the message in inverse video. Please be sure and
    delete your private messages so we can keep this facility in the forum. ATO
    will be pretty persistent about reminding you to delete a private message
    but it's for a good reason.

 F. AUTOSIG working files


    In addition to the AUTOSIG.DFN file, ATO creates quite a few files while
    it runs.  Each file has a name in this format:  [forumname]X.ATO, where
    "forumname" is the name you have given to a CompuServe forum in the Forum
    Configuration menu and X is a one-letter code indicating the file's 
    function.  For example, file IBMCOML.ATO is a file of messages you have
    written that are to be "left" in the IBMCOM Forum message board.

    H - message headers, the result of functions Q and H. Erased after
        headers have been marked and the corresponding messages downloaded
        from CIS by AUTOSIG.

    M - downloaded messages, from functions F, T, D, U, I, A, and Y.

    L - messages to be left on CIS, from function (W) or from one of the
        reply options of functions (R or V).  Erased after messages have been
        transmitted by AUTOSIG.

    S - an archival message file, from the S>ave option of function (R).

    R - a temporary file created for downloading messages and erased after
        those messages have been entered in the M file.


    If you use the archive command (alt-F10, or responding with K>eep from
    the S>end prompt in the editor) to save a message that you have written,
    the file created is named "forumname.FIL", where the "forumname" is the
    current Forum name.

    These files are searched for on the current drive and in the current
    directory, unless you supply an optional DOS environment setting for the
    ATO variable.  For example, to tell ATO to use the C drive and the path
    named ATO, you would supply the DOS command:

                SET ATO=C:\ATO

    before starting ATO, or by adding it to your AUTOEXEC.BAT. The bulletin
    file always uses the current drive and directory.

______________________________________________________________________________

 G. CIS High Message Number


    The starting message # (or "HMN") field on the Forum Configuration menu
    is automatically updated with the last message number scanned by AUTOSIG
    using the Q or H command.  This prevents ATO from repeating the same
    headers the next time it is used to scan.  It is necessary because the
    CIS scanning commands SF(N) and QS, which AUTOSIG uses for its own
    functions, do not update the High Message # in the forum.

    It may be that you find it easier to have the forum software manage your
    high message number.  If so hit Alt-N at the main ATO menu and ATO's 
    internal high message number will be reset to N>ew.

    Although CompuServe assigns no message numbers to CompuServe Mail
    messages, ATO automatically numbers Mail messages for reference
    purposes, and updates its HMN field accordingly.  You may choose any
    starting number by editing the forum options for your Mail entry.

    Section V has taken you through a taste of what AUTOSIG can do for you--
    in one Forum. Now it's time to look at AUTOSIG's two methods for working
    with as many forums as you find interesting--a number that will grow.

    The first method lets you move around manually while visiting several
    forums. The second, "AUTO", lets you do the same thing automatically,
    while you enjoy your cup of coffee.

______________________________________________________________________________

 A. Multiple Forum Sessions


    To "run" functions on multiple forum's you must first make sure that all 
    but the last one you plan to visit has the STAY CONNECTED option in your
    Forum Options set to "Y(es)".  If you haven't done that, you can simply 
    press <F3>, either from the Forum Functions Menu or from the main menu.
    Change the option to "Y" and then use PgDn/PgUp to change it in any other
    forums you need to. F10 returns you to where you were.

    The procedure for multiple forum actions during one connect
    sessions are as follows:

        1) Select the first forum you want to visit.

        2) Select the function menu option to perform the task you want.

        3) After the call is placed and the option you chose is executed you
           will be presented with  the main AUTOSIG  menu again.  The  message
           at the bottom center of the screen should say "PC IS CONNECTED".
           You are still connected.

        4) Use the PgDn key (change to another forum) to bring up the next
           forum you want to visit.  Or hit "C" to change to the Primary
           menu, and then hit a letter to choose the next forum.  Then <ENTER>
           to return to the function menu.

        5) After the new forum is selected enter the option for that forum
          (i.e. Q,F,H,T,S, etc.).

        6) Repeat this process for as many forums as you want to visit.

        7) Unless the last forum you visit has the "Stay connected" option set
           to "N(o)" in the configuration, select the Z option from the main
           AUTOSIG menu to send CIS a OFF command to disconnect.

 B. AUTO - Automatically Access Several Forums


    AUTO is a feature of ATO that enables an internally-generated batch file
    for AUTOSIG.  Menu-driven, it permits specifying a routine for ATO to
    follow for online sessions.  The batch file is stored in the DFN file.

    There are three parts to AUTO:

        -  the AUTO list, which you create by pressing <F7> at the ATO main
           menu. See CREATING YOUR AUTO LIST, below.

        -  the first AUTO pass, also referred  to as /1 or 1 or F1; in which
           ATO  automatically  accesses CIS to download  Mail messages,
           messages headers, or message threads.  On this first AUTO pass, ATO
           will also upload any replies you have waiting from a previous
           session.

        -  the second AUTO pass, also referred to as /2 or 2 or F2; in which
           ATO processes your offline requests such as sending replies or
           download messages whose headers you have marked.



    1. STARTING AUTO

    AUTO can be started in many ways:  by using " /1" as part of your command
    to load AUTOSIG, e.g., "AUTOSIG /1" or "AUTOSIG /2.  (The space before the 
    slash is necessary.)  Use the " /1" extension only if a AUTO List has
    already been created.  Or you can select the pass 1 (F1) or pass 2 (F2)
    items from the Primary menu, or use the 1 or 2 commands from the main
    Function menu.

    If you use the command line switches " /1" or " /2", you can also select
    which of your Host settings will be used. Enter the number (0-9) of the
    Host: i.e., AUTOSIG /13 will do /1 using Host 3.

    The F1 and F2 keys require that you enter the time of day when AUTO is to
    execute.  (See Figure 7) If you just press the <enter> key, AUTO begins
    immediately.  Otherwise, you may enter the time and/or day when AUTO is
    to run.  The time must be supplied in the format "hh:mm" where "hh" is
    the hour in military/24 hour format, and "mm" is the minutes.  For
    example, if you want AUTO pass 1 to begin at 4:35 pm, you would enter
    16:35.

    If AUTO is to start on another day, you supply the date after the time in
    the format ",mm-dd" where the coma is required between the time and date,
    and "mm" is the current month number (e.g. 9 for September), and the "dd 
    is the day of the month.  For example, to start AUTO at 4:35 pm on
    September 9, enter "16:35,09-09" when asked "When?".

    If you'd like to start your AUTO pass from the command line and bypass 
    the menu/function keys you can use the "switch" /@hh:mm where hh:mm is
    the time of day when the AUTO function is to run.

    2. AUTO features

    For forums selected on the AUTO list, AUTO will S>end or D>ownload
    messages automatically as well.  After the first pass with AUTO, the
    "2" option can be used.  Selecting this causes AUTO to scan your disks
    to see if there are messages waiting to be sent or downloaded.  If
    there are, ATO will go online again to perform those functions.

    AUTO stays in this mode until you return to DOS.  Because of this, you
    can use the (Q) option for a quick scan; use "2" to download the
    messages; R>ead them offline; compose replies offline; and then use "2"
    again to S>end replies.

    *  IMPORTANT:  Whenever you select AUTO, whether AUTO1 or AUTO2, it checks
    *  all forums in the AUTO list which have commands to see if there are any
    *  (D) or (S) files.  If a listed forum has no commands next to it (all
    *  blanks), it is not checked, whether there are (D) or (S) files for it
    *  or not.

    *  Also note that since both AUTO passes automatically S>end and D>ownload,
    *  there is no need to put "S" or "D" by your active forums on the AUTO
    *  list.

    If you'd prefer to use ATO without AUTO, it can still help.  You can use 
    "/2" anytime you want to go online to download messages you marked
    offline, or to send new messages.  It's a good way to see how quickly 
    AUTO works, and you won't be taken back online unless you have a live D> 
    or (S) file.  In use, the main menu item of choice offline becomes "C".

    Also, your O>ption choice of "Y" or "N" for "Stay connected y/n" in your
    AUTOSIG.DFN file is overridden by AUTO, so there's no need to change it

    from what you normally use 'manually.'  You can exit out of AUTO at any
    time by hitting <Esc> <Esc>.  If you do it before your modem responds
    with "CONNECT", AUTO will hang up and return you to the main menu.


    3. Creating your AUTO list

    If you have never defined an AUTO list, you will need to do so now. From
    the primary menu (first ATO screen) or a forum menu, press <F7>. You are
    then presented with an AUTO list of forums and commands. (See Figure 7)

    Move the cursor next to a forum you wish to access automatically.  Enter
    the letters for each command that you wish to perform, e.g.  Q to download
    Quick Scan headers. Forums where you make no choices will not be part of
    /1 or /2. NOTE: Only "F" should be chosen for Mail.

    Press <F10> when you are finished, and you are returned to the
    Primary menu.  Your AUTO list has now been stored in the AUTOSIG.DFN file.
    It will maintain this configuration until you change it again.

VII. Electronic Mail (CompuServe Mail) Operation
______________________________________________________________________________


    Although forum messages are one way of communicating when you know that
    the addressee will check the forum, AUTOSIG makes sending messages via
    CIS's electronic mail system ("CompuServe Mail") simple.  It's a good
    idea to use CompuServe Mail when you're not sure if the recipient is 
    going to be on the forum in time to pick up the message before it
    scrolls off.

    In AUTOSIG's MAIL routine, messages are reformatted so they can be 
    handled just like forum messages.  You may also send MAIL by composing a
    reply to a forum message and then using the M or MA option.

VII. Electronic Mail (CompuServe Mail) Operation
______________________________________________________________________________

 A. Setting Up Your Mail "Forum"


    Select the menu letter for MAIL ('A' as of this writing), then select
    the Edit HOST Options item, F3.  You are presented with a Forum
    Configuration Options Menu.  You can rename the "mail" Forum if you
    like, but the name must contain "MAIL", "Mail" or "mail" in order to
    work.  The CIS page number for this Forum must be "MAIL"
    The importance of the set up can't be stressed enough, if they aren't
    properly set up ATO just won't work. Basically don't mess with the
    defaults and you'll be okay. 

    With the correct parameters, Mail will appear to be identical to the
    forums, with only a couple of exceptions:

        - The "To:" prompt normally takes the name of the person you are
          sending a message to, with the PPN going on the next line.  However,
          the "Id:" line will  accept a CIS ID number, a MCI Mail number,
          a FAX number, or an INTERNET address, but only up to 24 characters.
          If the name and address of the person you're sending to is longer 
          than 24 characters and not a CIS address, you'll need, for the time 
          being, to use the workaround given in Appendix E.

          Please see the following page for more info on FAX/MCI.

        - Some AUTOSIG menu options, because of the way electronic mails
          works are not available. <Q>uick scan and <M>ark, for example don't 
          work with CompuServe Mail and are therefore not on the menu.

        - Mail messages are numbered  by ATO beginning with number  1.  You
          may  change  this  starting  number  by  selecting  the Edit Forum
          Options item from the Primary menu, and changing the High  Message
          Number (HMN) for your MAIL forum.

        - If you want to send a Mail message with a return receipt requested
          enter /REC in the Section field of the message send window.


    Now that your Mail forum is set up, you'll need to do one more thing--go 
    on-line and add your name to your CompuServe Mail Address Book.

    The CompuServe Mail address book is a list maintained by CompuServe of
    names and PPNs that you enter.  Using it means that you can send Mail
    by name, and the address book will supply the PPN.  For ATO's MAIL 
    functions to work properly you need to enter at least your own name and
    PPN in the list; you'll find it convenient to add the names of people 
    you're in touch with often. 

    The prompt character is not used by ATO during Mail operation.

VII. Electronic Mail (CompuServe Mail) Operation
______________________________________________________________________________

 B. Special Features in CompuServe Mail




    1. Using the Address Book

    When you are using AUTOSIG to send Mail to someone who's in your online 
    Address Book, you'll need just an * and the name, as *Joe Smith. 
    Otherwise, ATO will prompt you for a full PPN.


    2. Binary Mail

    You can send and receive binary Mail--program files, ARC'd documents, 
    etc.--via CompuServe Mail.

    To send binary Mail you must be in terminal mode and use the CompuServe
    Mail UPLOAD command.  You will need to know the recipient's PPN, unless 
    it is in your online Address Book.  Or, you can automate the binary
    Mail upload process with a script.

    If you receive a binary MAIL message, AUTOSIG will download it
    automatically, using the CIS B protocol. It will not be part of the
    regular MAILM.ATO file; each binary message will be saved in a separate
    MAILMSG.nnn file, where 'nnn' is the message number assigned by ATO.



    3. Sending Mail to MCI Subscribers

    You can send Electronic Mail directly to subscribers on the MCI Mail
    network through CompuServe Mail.  You'll need to know the recipient's
    MCI "address".  Prepare your message in the usual way; the only
    difference is that when you type the "Id:"  section, you'll need to 
    format the address as follows:

        >MCIMAIL: MCI ID



    4. Sending FAX messages via Mail

    This service enables you to send text files to anyone, anywhere, with a
    FAX machine.  You'll need to know the FAX machine's phone number, of
    course.

    Create your message in the usual way, either by typing it, or by
    importing it into your editing area (See instructions in Message Editor
    section) and put the "Attn:"  name in the "To:"  area of the "send 
    window". and then put >FAX:nnnnnnnnn in the "Id:"  area of the send 
    window.

VIII.  ATO Terminal Mode
______________________________________________________________________________

 A. Overview


    In addition to automatic access to CompuServe, ATO can be used as a
    simple terminal program.  This enables you to

               - go to other CIS areas
               - upload or download files from the forum libraries
               - save CIS information in a disk file
               - use split screen in a conference


    1. Entering Terminal Mode

    Terminal mode is entered by selecting function option (G).  You are given
    the option to automatically logon to CIS.  The current configuration
    setting is used for dialing and page information.  When you enter the
    forum via the "Go on-line" function ATO sends the string "OP;SM N;S" which
    will put you in non-stop mode.  You may manually send OP;SM A;S to put you
    back into stop-between-message mode.

    Terminal mode is also entered when the "ESCape" key is entered twice from
    the keyboard while ATO is online.  The function that is being performed
    will be aborted, and you will go directly into Terminal mode.

    You can also use the "ESCape" key to tell ATO to first finish the function
    or Auto pass it is doing and then go into Terminal mode. To do this, press
    "ESCape" ONCE. When the function or Auto pass that is being performed
    finishes, you will be left in Terminal mode.


    2. Leaving Terminal Mode

    To exit terminal mode, and return to the Function Menu, enter a "ctrl-D"
    key combination.  You are asked:

                  "Have you left forum-name? (y/N) 

    If you went to another forum while in terminal mode, reply Y. Otherwise,
    press enter. If you have set "Stay connected" in your forum options to
    No, you are asked:  "Stay connected?  (Y/n)".  Reply Y if you want to
    stay connected and access more forums.  Otherwise, reply N and ATO will
    log you off. You can avoid this prompt by using ctrl-X instead of ctrl-D
    to return to the main Forum function menu.


    3. Vidtex Escape Sequences

    If your CIS terminal parameters have you defined as a Vidtex terminal, ATO
    recognizes most of the special escape sequences for clearing the screen
    and positioning the cursor.  Please note that Vidtex escape sequences are
    NOT processed until you enter terminal mode!  This is done only to improve
    performance.  Once you are on-line in terminal mode all Vidtex escape
    sequences will be executed.

VIII.  ATO Terminal Mode
______________________________________________________________________________

 B. Terminal Mode Function Keys


    The keyboard keys F1 through F10 are available as Program Function Keys.
    Pressing one of these keys "sends" a command that you have assigned to
    the key.  You may create a separate set of Function key definitions for
    each forum. These sets are saved in the DFN file for each forum.  You
    create (or modify) these definitions by using the "alt-K" key combination.



    1. Defining Function Keys

    Alt-K results in a display of the current key definitions. This is a
    small window in the upper right corner of the display. (See Figure 9,
    below) Use the cursor positioning keys and other keyboard keys to add or
    modify data. The Enter key moves to the next key definition line. All
    function key strings are sent automatically when pressed. A carriage
    return is automatically appended to your key definition unless you end
    the definition with a left brace { character.

    You do not need to be online to define these keys. Select G>o online for
    AUTOSIG's main menu, and you'll be prompted to determine if you want to
    go online. Reply "N", and then hit the Alt-K key combination.

    Use the F10 key to end the editing of the key definitions, and to
    return to Terminal Mode. The first six characters of each key are
    displayed, as a reminder, on line 25 of the display whenever Terminal
    Mode is entered. You may remove the line 25 display by using the alt-C
    keys.



    2. Special Characters for Function Keys

    The function key text may contain these special characters:

        {  left brace, suppresses adding a carriage return to the text
        ~  tilde, causes a one second pause before processing the next
           character. The tilde is not transmitted.
        ^  caret, identifies the next character as a control character,
           for example:  ^C for control-C,  ^P for control-P,  etc.

 C. Terminal Mode Special Keys


    In addition to the Function keys you assign (above), ATO provides a
    number of other Terminal Mode functions to special keys. They may be used
    at any time while in Terminal Mode. You can see a display of these keys
    anytime in Terminal Mode by pressing Alt-A.

 D. "Intermediate" Mode


    This one is easier to use than to explain, but in prior versions of ATO
    you had two basic options in terminal mode when you wanted to perform a
    function; do it manually or hit ctrl-D to bring up an ATO forum menu.

    There is now a new "mini-menu" function. Start ATO with the /V switch and
    when you're thru with one forum hit ctrl-D and you'll get a one line
    prompt.

    You can then enter any valid ATO function letter at this prompt or, just
    as you can in the forum screens, use the PgUp and PgDn keys to run thru
    your forum list.

    Give it a try, it's easier to use than to describe.

VIII.  ATO Terminal Mode
______________________________________________________________________________

 E. Protocol File Transfer


    Files from the Forum Libraries may be "downloaded" from CIS to your
    system by using ATO in the Terminal Mode.  You tell CIS to download a
    file by using commands such as READ, TYPE, or DOW when you are given the
    LIB ! prompt by CIS, or from the file prompt given at the file level
    during the BRO command while in the Data Libraries.

    To enter Terminal Mode, select the (G) Go Online function from the
    Function Menu, or press the ESCape key while ATO is performing an
    automatic function such as T or simply change the forum option to "stay 
    connected". 

    ATO uses CIS "Quick B" protocol if you need to know. Chances are it's so 
    automatic the point will be moot as we'll see. 


    1. Downloading with "B" protocol

    If you use the BRO command just hit the PgDn key at the Disposition!
    prompt for the file you've selected, and everything from there on out will 
    be automatic.  The filename used by the Data Library will be used on
    your system. If you are using the READ or SCA command, you must tell CIS
    to DOWnload the file, and you must specify the name you would like the
    file to bear on your disk.  Either way, where the file ends up on your
    system is determined by you: If you have made an entry in the "File 
    transfer d:\path" field in the HOST configuration the file will be placed 
    in that directory or drive; otherwise it will be in the current drive or
    sub-directory.

    After that, the transfer is automatic. You'll see received block # 
    messages, and after the transfer you'll see number of characters 
    transferred, elapsed time and characters per second. The NAK value
    represents the number of times CIS requested that a block be
    retransmitted. The ENQ value should be zero. If not, CIS has tried to
    interrupt the file transfer and ATO may have trouble continuing.

    The top line of the display during CIS Quick B file transfers tells you
    the name of the file and when the transfer started. If you are uploading
    a file, the file's size is also displayed. 

    The bottom line of the display is a status line. It tells you the number
    of bytes of "File:"  that have been transferred to or from a file, the
    number of bytes "Sent:" and "Rcvd:", and the number of "Naks:" negative
    response due to errors and re-transmissions. The "File:" count represents
    the number of bytes of the actual file that have been recorded; "Rcvd"
    will be a higher figure, since it includes protocol overhead as well as
    extra bytes representing blocks which had to be re-sent. Because Quick B
    is capable of changing block size depending on line conditions, the rate
    at which the counters go up may vary (but it's not likely). 

    Files may also be uploaded (sent) to forum libraries using "B" protocol.
    Use the UPL command at the LIB! prompt, and follow the directions from

 F. Non-Protocol Transfers


    Although a protocol transfer is the way to go for program files, and will
    guarantee an error-free transfer for other files, there are occasions when
    you will want to use a non-protocol transfer, either to capture a short
    file in a buffer to read off-line, or to "log" a session or conference.



    1. Using a Log or Capture Buffer File

    If you wish to record a conference you're taking part in, or simply 
    "capture" a text file in the Libraries as it reads across your screen, or
    just to catch everything that happens on the screen, ATO will create a
    "log" file for you.

    The "alt-L" or "alt-D" key combination will open a disk file and begin
    logging. Any data sent by CIS - messages, etc.  - is written to this
    file until "alt-L" or "alt-D" is pressed again. If you haven't closed it 
    before you leave Terminal Mode, ATO will close it for you.

    The letter C appears in the lower right corner of the screen to remind
    you that file capture is in progress.


    2. Downloading Text Files or Basic ASCII Files

    To "download" text files or Basic programs saved in ASCII format, while
    you're BROwsing through the Data Library, select "R" (without <Enter> ); 
    hit Alt-L; name the file as requested by ATO and then hit <Enter> twice.
    When the download is complete (CIS sends 'Key <Enter> to continue) hit 
    Alt-L again to close the file on your PC, followed by <Enter>.


    3. Non-Protocol (ASCII) Upload from disk

    The "alt-U" key combination initiates an ASCII (not protocol) upload
    operation. You may supply a prompt character for ATO to wait for, or you
    may let ATO upload the file without any delays. You supply the name of a
    file to be transferred to CIS.

IX.   Message Editor
______________________________________________________________________________


    The AUTOSIG editor is a key part of the program.  Its purpose is to let
    you reply to messages you have downloaded for reading, or to compose
    send new messages, almost as if you were on-line.  Actually, of course,
    it's much better than being on-line:  You can do things you could never 
    do on-line, including:

      * Glance back as often as you like at the message you are replying to,
      * Conveniently edit your work, reformat, cut-and-paste, etc.
      * Import other files into your message
      * Automatically insert the recipient's name and PPN from your ATO PPN 
        list for new messages.
      * And much more--all off-line so you don't have the meter ticking. 

    The Message Editor will allow you to send messages in nearly any form:
    with CIS formatting, or without; Privately with CIS formatting, or
    Privately without; via Mail, FAX or to a user on another Mail
    system. You also have the opportunity to change any of those choices
    before sending.

 A. General Description


    The AUTOSIG editor is a full screen editor which makes use of most of the
    special function keys on the PC keyboard as well as ALT key combinations.
    Generally speaking most of the commands and functions are intuitive if
    you've used a text editor before. Because it is a full screen editor you 
    can move around the screen using the cursor keys and make changes as you
    wish.

    The screen consists of 25 rows by 80 columns. The first 23 rows contain
    message lines. Row 24 contains the addressee and subject information for
    the Leave or Reply message. Row 25 lists the function key definitions.

    You may hit the F1 function key for help in the editor.

    Each message line is numbered, from 1 to 80, in column 78 of each display
    row. You may position the cursor to any line on the display, or use the
    <Enter> key to position to the next line.

    The maximum number of lines you may enter is 198, but Forum messages
    are limited to about 2000 characters, or about 25 lines.  The editor
    will warn you of this when you reach the 2000th character.  You should
    end the message, and start a new one if necessary to continue.  The
    limit of 198 lines is permitted for CompuServe Mail messages which can
    be much larger than Forum messages.

    The editor has full wordwrap. It will advance to the next line at an
    appropriate point. In addition you can force a reformat of the the rest of
    a paragraph as you edit by using the Alt-f function.

    Any lines beginning with a slash, /, are sent without the slash. Double
    slashes at the beginning of a line are sent.

 B. Using the Message Editor's functions 



    1. Insert and Delete Functions

    The message editor will function in either insert or overwrite mode. You
    choose the default in the PC Options setup area of AUTOSIG (Press <ESC> at
    the Primary Menu), by answering Y or N to /J Insert Mode. Whichever mode
    you selected at that point, you can use the Insert key to toggle back and
    forth while you're in the Message Editor. If you want to make a permanent 
    change, though, you'll have to go back to the PC Options. 

       [F5]                Inserts a blank line after the current line.

       [ENTER]             At bottom of message: Adds blank lines
                           In Insert mode: Splits line at cursor
                           In Overwrite: Moves to next line, inserting one if
                           necessary.

       F6                  Deletes the entire current line--even if you are
                           not at the beginning of the line.

       Ctrl-END            Erases from the cursor to the end of current line.

       Ctrl-left           Deletes the current word

       Ctrl-T              Deletes from the cursor to the next word

       [Ins]               Toggle between insert and typeover mode.
                           The letter "I" appears on line 25 to indicate
                           that the keyboard is in "insert" mode.

       [Del]               Delete character presently at cursor location

       [Backspace]         Except at the beginning of line, deletes character
                           to the left of the cursor.  At the beginning of a
                           line, it moves the line to the end of the
                           preceding line.

    2. Moving Around in the Editor

    There are many ways to move around within the message you are composing:

       Cursor keys         Move cursor in the arrow direction.

       [Enter]             Move to new line, creating a new line if needed
                           [Enter] again moves the cursor to next line. With
                           Insert mode enabled, splits the current line.

       [Home]              Move to start of line.

       [End]               Position to end of text on current line.

       [PgUp]              Display prior 11 lines.

       [PgDn]              Display next 11 lines.

       Ctrl-PgUp           Position to first line of text.

       Ctrl-PgDn           Position to last line of text.

       Ctrl-Home           Position to first line of message.

       [TAB]               Moves the cursor to the next TAB column.
                           The TAB columns are 1, 9, 17, 25, etc.

       [Ctrl][Left Arrow]  Skips to the previous word.

       [Ctrl][Right Arrow] Skips to the next word.

        F10 Save   (WPR)  Save current message (in forumL.ATO).
                          While P>reviewing, the message is kept in the
                          Leave/Reply file to be sent.

        Alt-F10    (WPR)  Hitting Alt and F10 at the same time will save
                          your message to forumL.ATO just as F10 does, and
                          also to a file with the extension .FIL. This
                          is useful for keeping chronological files of
                          your messages, which is useful in Mail, where
                          you cannot read your messages online once they
                          have been sent.

    When you are finished editing and use F10 to save the message, you
    receive the prompt:

    S>ave, A>lter mode, C>arbon copy, R>eturn to editing, K>eep a copy

    where:
          S>ave    stores the message in forumL.ext for sending later

 C. Importing Files


    You press F9 to tell ATO to import a file.  This allows you to read a
    file into the editor work area.  Thus, you can insert data from files
    directly into your messages.

    When you press F9, ATO asks you to where to find the file:

               Enter import d:\path [C:\ATO]

    If you know the name of the file you wish to import, you may type it in
    at the end of the path shown.  If it is in a different directory, you may
    also edit the path.  If you do not know the name of the file, ATO can show
    you a directory.  Press <enter> to see a directory for the drive and path
    shown, or type in a new drive and path and press <enter>.  ATO will then
    display a list of files in that directory.  For example:

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    AUTOSIG.DFN    AUTOSIG.JUN    ATODOC.001   ATO.EXE  ACLS.EXE   PANELS.2
    IBMCOMM.ATO    IBMCOML.ATO    IBMCOMS.ATO

    File to import:

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Enter the name of the file you wish to Import, or press Enter to change
    to another directory.  If ATO cannot find the file, you will receive the
    message:

            filename not found.
            Key 'X' to abort; any other key to retry.

    Press X to cancel the import request, or press Enter to re-enter the
    drive and path names.

    When you import a file while writing a message, that file becomes part of
    the message you are writing, and it is displayed.

    Because the ATO Message Editor has a 198-line limit on message size, the
    file you wish to import must be within that size, or must be edited to
    size. The Message Editor will truncate the import after 150 lines; if the
    portion you need to include is further down the file, you will need to
    first edit it with a text editor or word processor.

    If your message is a Reply, all of the fields will already be filled in
    for you.  If you would like to change the contents of any of them, move
    the cursor to the field you want to change, and type the new information.
    Editing fields in the Send box is the same as editing the Forum or Host
    options.

    If you are writing a new message, you will have to supply the
    information in the Send window.  Enter the name of the person to whom
    you wish to send the message after "To:" in the window.

    Place the person's user id (PPN) after "Id:".  If you don't know the
    id, and have saved a file of user names and id's with the ATO PPN 
    processor, press PgUp to get access to your PPN database.

    To send to a FAX, MCI, or other service user, place their address in the
    "Id:" field.  The address consists of a greater-than, >, symbol, and the
    name of the service, and the person's address.  The "To:" user name is 
    used as the information for the service's "Attention:" request.

    in terminal mode (see terminal mode section) - you can call up that
    list by pressing the PgDn key.

    Finally, choose a "mode" of sending the message.

    "S" will send the message and permit CIS to reformat it to the screen
    format set by anyone who reads it.

    "U" will send the message exactly as written.  This is convenient if you
    include tables in a message.

    "P" sends the message privately on forums where this option is enabled.
    IMPORTANT:  AUTOSIG does not trap errors if you attempt to send a
    (P)rivate message on a forum where the Sysop does not allow this type of
    message. Don't use this option unless you're certain that it is
    permitted.

    At this writing, the IBMNET Forums allow private messages.

    "X" sends the message Privately, as is, and instructs CIS to not reformat
    it.

    "M" sends the message as CompuServe Mail by using the MAIL command

    "Y" is the same as M, but tells CIS not to reformat.

    1. Message editor split

    The forum message system has a finite limit on the length of the message
    and we've found that 2,000 characters is a good rule of thumb. The ATO 
    editor will remind you when you've reached this limit. At this point you 
    may elect to split the message at any location.

    Move the cursor to the location where you want the message split and just
    hit Alt-B ("Break).  The total number of characters contained in the 
    first part of the message will be displayed and you'll be prompted to 
    split at that point or continue.  If you elect to split the message a
    "split line" will display on the screen and you can continue editing the
    second half of the message.  Using this method the first message will be
    sent with a [More] indicator and each subsequent message will start with
    [Continued].

X.  Problems and Solutions
______________________________________________________________________________

 A. Internal Errors


    If an error occurs during execution, a message is displayed on the top
    line of the display, such as ERROR 52 in LINE 1020.

    The message contains an error code which is described in the BASIC
    manual, and the line number where the problem occurred.

    If you can't resolve the problem, make a note of the error message and 
    give the information to one of the authors. Leaving a message in section
    1 (the ATO section) of IBMCOM is the quickest way.

    After the error, the Function Menu is displayed. Depending on the
    problem, you may decide to continue or terminate. Any files created by
    ATO are left on the current drive.  Thus, you may restart processing at a
    later time.

    By far the most common problem is a lack of response by AUTOSIG when it
    receives the forum "Function" prompt. Rather than giving the command based
    upon your menu selection it just sits there.

    The problem is more than likely due to an inconsistency between the
    prompt character that's been defined in the forum OPtion area and the ^G 
    that ATO uses.

    If you are using a computer that may not be IBM compatible, the screen
    displays may be empty. This is due to the way ATO places data directly
    into the monitor's display buffer. The /T command-line parameter can be 
    used to force ATO to write to the display without using the IBM-specific
    display buffer addresses.

    Remember that the default ATO prompt character is a Ctrl-G (Bell)
    character. This must be entered in the forum OPtion area as ^G (the ^ key
    is the shifted 6 key). The CIS OPTION program will not accept CTRL-G as
    a valid prompt character.

    Be sure to keep a backup copy of your AUTOSIG.DFN file.  Many problems
    can be solved by using a "good" DFN file, or by recreating it.  You can
    force ATO to update the DFN file by using the Alt-N command.

______________________________________________________________________________

 B. Forum and General Trouble Shooting


    AUTOSIG traps and recovers from all possible errors that the authors have
    identified.  There are only two occasions when you're likely to see any 
    indication of an error.

    The first is if you see ASCII 243 on your screen (the mathematical symbol
    for "less than or equal to").  This indicates that ATO has trapped an
    error at the modem.  This is likely to happen once or twice both logging
    on and logging off, and is not a problem.  If it happens repeatedly
    elsewhere, check your modem and the wires connecting it to the PC. Other
    special symbols define other modem errors. A complete list follows:


                x'F3' =    Overrun error
                x'F5' =    Parity error
                x'F7' =    Overrun and parity errors
                x'F9' =    Framing error
                x'FD' =    Parity and framing errors
                x'FB' =    Overrun and framing errors
                x'FE' =    Overrun, parity and framing errors

          (Note: some printers may not print the actual characters)

    The second is if you didn't let ATO run its full course and broke out of 
    the program or turned your computer off before returning to DOS.  This
    will not harm your computer, but it may leave some stray files behind.
    No corrective action is needed, except to always try to let ATO run its
    full course, from DOS to execution and back to DOS.  Since ATO has so
    many files open it's a good idea to do a CHKDSK to identify any lost 
    clusters.  This action will probably result in your "high message number"
    being corrupted if you use one of the AUTOSIG functions that maintains
    and depends on that number.

    Other than these two problems, if you see a message in the upper right
    corner of your display indicating "Error nn at Line nnnnn", please leave
    a message in section 1 of the IBM Communications Forum (IBMCOM).  One
    of the authors will respond.

    If you're having problems with ATO's display, this is probably caused by
    incompatibility between your computer and some of the ATO code, which is
    IBM-PC specific.  Although ATO runs fine "as is" on most compatibles,
    there are several "switches" that can get around compatibility problems.
    See the section on Switches.

    There are other problems that can arise when CompuServe is acting up and
    sends something ATO doesn't expect.  Again, most of these problems are 
    trapped and fixed automatically, but, given the large number of possible
    miscues that CIS can generate, not all can be fixed.  Here are some of
    the possible ones:

 B. Forum and General Trouble Shooting


    ATO freezes; No action at all

    Make sure that you have set your forum prompt character at ^G, especially
    if this happens at the Forum !  prompt.  Otherwise:

    Wait a full minute.  The problem could be that CIS is busy.  If there is
    still no sign of activity, hit <ESCape> twice followed by CTRL-C.  This
    should put you into direct contact with CIS at a menu that gives you
    several options, including logoff.  Select that one and try again later.


    ATO logs on and immediately logs off when it reaches a forum

    Double check your forum options and ensure that you are in command mode
    rather than menu mode. The reason for the immediate log off is that ATO
    sees the "Press <CR> to continue" as an error condition.


    Message sent to wrong forum

    This can happen using AUTO on a very noisy phone line.  What has happened
    is that CIS sent a false signal causing ATO to think that it had moved on
    to another forum.  This error never happens on a good connection.  There's 
    no way ATO can fix it.  FEEDBACK to CIS might help.


    Files Busy (Code xxnn) ...

    This is a CIS message that, unfortunately, gives you only two choices:
    wait it out or pull the plug.  None of this is unique to ATO; you'd have 
    the same problem if you logged on manually.  If you choose to pull the
    plug, hit <ESC><ESC>, which will return you to the ATO menu with the
    message that the "PC is CONNECTED".  Hit "Z".  This will send "OFF" to
    CIS and disconnect the modem.  Once CIS recognizes your action, it will
    log you off.


    {{ Characters

    This symbol is encountered when there is a lot of noise on the line.
    Your best bet is to abort ATO as quickly as possible if you see this
    symbol repeatedly.


    PC is CONNECTED

    This message is normal when CIS answers the call, but is incorrect if
    seen at any other time UNLESS YOU ARE ACTUALLY CONNECTED!!  This is caused
    by one of two problems; the setting of DTR in your modem or a serial cable
    that doesn't have a full complement of pins. Actually some comm programs 
    will let you get by with less than 5 pins. ATO, because it wants to

 B. Forum and General Trouble Shooting

    carefully monitor what's going on, needs a DTR pin. 
    See the suggested modem settings in the setup section.


    ATO freezes when entering a forum

    This is probably due to a mismatch between the prompt character defined
    to ATO and that defined in the forum options area. Double check the
    settings in the forum via the OPTION command and in ATO via the ESC key
    at the main screen.


    ATO stops at "Enter carriage return to continue"

    You need to set your forum to command mode. Hit ESC twice and check your
    forum OPTION area and make sure you're set for COMMAND mode. 


    CompuServe Mail problems

    You can name the CompuServe Mail "forum" whatever you like, as
    long as the name contains "MAIL", "Mail" or "mail".

    Although ATO makes CompuServe Mail look and act like a forum, when you
    leave a message, you are actually doing a file transfer, rather than a
    line-by-line dump.


    Message you sent arrives To: and From: YOU

    ATO tries in several different ways to recover from inability to send a
    reply to a message.  As a last resort, ATO will send your message to you.
    If it looks like you're talking to yourself, it simply means that ATO and 
    CIS couldn't find any other way to deliver the message. 


    % NTWCPR - ...

      % NTWJRP - Job Rec....

    ATO will wait out most CIS problems and resume faultlessly.  However,
    there is one situation (a CIS failure followed by a recovery) when CIS
    asks you to send a CTRL-Q.  If you do this manually at the CIS prompt,
    ATO will recover as well.  If you don't, CIS will disconnect you in about 
    two minutes and ATO will return to the main menu.


    ATO fails sending a P)rivate message

    Some Sysops have chosen not to permit (P)rivate messages.  Since ATO
    cannot possibly keep up to date on what options are available on the
    various forums, it's up to you to know whether you can send a private

    message on a given forum.  If in doubt, send it public (using 'S' or 'U'),
    check first with the Sysop, or try it 'manually' before trying it with
    ATO.


    ATO hangs up or aborts a file transfer

    File transfers can fail for any number of reasons, including so much line
    noise that CIS simply aborts.  By watching the NAK and ENQ values, you
    can get an idea of how smoothly a transfer is proceeding.  An excessively
    high NAK value indicates that the line connection is poor and you should
    probably log off and call back.  It may help to try another phone number,
    or lower the baud rate.  In any event, report your problems to FEEDBACK
    and they may credit your account for the time lost.


    ATO won't go on-line 

    Some modems use "unusual" comm port addressing or non-standard IRQ
    settings. You may have this problem even tho other software works.
    Usually this is because the software has been especially modified to
    use the unique addresses/IRQ. Check your documentation carefully and
    consult appendix C for other comm port addresses you might want to try or
    change the address and IRQ on your modem. This condition is especially
    true of the Everex modem bundled with Bitcom.


    AUTO Pass 2 won't run 

    Some modems can't handle the speed at which ATO sends commands and the 
    hangup command from AUTO pass 1 will remain in the modems buffer. Adjust
    your host entry and insert delays between the modem attention command and
    the hang up command.

    written from scratch entirely by Vern Buerg simply to save on his monthly
    bills.

    This first version was further expanded and modified by Vern Buerg,

    Group established by Don Watkins, SYSOP of IBMNET.  A sister program,
    ACLS, was written by Tom Neff and updated by Don Watkins. ATOBRO,
    ATO's library manager and download script generator was written by 
    Vern Buerg and Don Watkins.

    A very special thanks to those who helped test the numerous interim
    versions of ATO.  Space limits individual thanks, but without them ATO
    would not be where it is today. Kudos in no particular order:

Appendix B: Command Line Options
______________________________________________________________________________


    You may supply one or more command line options to change the default
    operation of ATO.  Each switch must begin with the slash "/" character.
    Many of the switches below can be set permanently in the PC Options menu
    in ATO. The command line switches, if used, will override those settings,
    but only for one session.

    The command-line switch letters may be in upper or lower case. Example:

                AUTOSIG /1/Q/F   is the same as AUTOSIG /1/q/f

    Here is a list of the option switches and their effects:

   /B    tells ATO not to accept input from the keyboard during AUTO
   /C    causes the screen to be cleared before a message is displayed
   /D    tells ATO to bypass carrier detection
   /E    enables error debug mode to print all error messages on LPT1
   /F    disables sending a form feed to the printer when printing messages
   /H    indicates that your monitor does not require retrace testing
   /I    tells ATO that a mouse is available for input in the Primary Menu
   /J    changes the messages editor's input mode to insert 
   /K    sets the Mail message disposition to Keep
   /M    tells ATO to send an RM (Read Marked) when appropriate
   /N    selects new-style message headers for reading
   /O    instructs ATO to use the old B protocol instead of Quick B
   /P    tells ATO to send a ctrl-P at logon to minimize logon and forum
         introductory messages
   /Q    turns off the speaker for quiet operation
   /S    forces a sort of the Quick Scan headers by the Mark function
   /T    tells ATO to use normal BIOS routines for displaying to the screen
   /U    suppresses ^U prefixing (sending ctrl-U before sending commands)
   /V    tells ATO to use command mode instead of menu mode
   /Y    tells ATO to bypass logon messages and Mail checking (quick logon)
   /Z    tells ATO to return to DOS after logging off

   /1    invokes the AUTO first pass immediately.
         A number 0-9, corresponding to one of your numbered
         Hosts, may be added to this switch. /13, for example, will
         cause ATO to do an Auto first pass using your Host 3.

   /2    invokes the AUTO second pass immediately.
         You may specify a Host; see /1, above.


   /4    instructs ATO to run in 43-line mode with an EGA display


   /Gx   supplies a new prompt character, where 'x' is a letter; for example
             AUTOSIG /GH
         results  in  ATO  using  the  control-H  character (backspace) as a
         prompt rather than the default control-G (BEL) character.


   /Lext supplies an optional file extension for ATO files; the default is
         ATO. For example, /LOLD would use the extension .OLD for all ATO
         files.


   /@hh:mm  supplies the time of day when the AUTO function is to run.


   /Xf   supplies the name of a script file 'f' to be execute as soon as the
         logon has completed, e.g. /XDL  would run the file called DL.SCR.
         This is handy for doing automatic file transfers.

Appendix C: Comm Port Addresses
______________________________________________________________________________


          The filenames COM1 thru COM8 have no relationship to DOS.
          They are simply names assigned to base port addresses by ATO:

                        Base address    IRQ Line
                COM1       03F8            4
                COM2       02F8            3
                COM3       03F8            3
                COM4       02F8            4
                COM5       3220            3  (PS/2 COM3)
                COM6       3228            3  (PS/2 COM4)
                COM7       03E8            4
                COM8       02E8            3

Appendix D: Gateway Processing
______________________________________________________________________________


    There are a number of areas on CIS which require ATO to pass through a
    "gateway".  The area on the other side of the gateway will contain one
    or more forums with a menu structure of their own--sort of like a miniature
    CIS.

    The best-known of these areas in PCMagNet, operated by PC Magazine and
    the PC-Week Forum areas.

    To have ATO go through a gateway, add the gateway "name" prior to the
    forum name on the "GO to page" entry in the Forum menu, for example:

                PCW:FORUM

    will result in a direct access to the PC Week area and a GO to the
    PC Week forum.

    You may return to CompuServe forums by using the CIS "gateway" prefix
    again for your next forum. For instance:

               CIS:IBMCOM

    will take you back to CompuServe and log you into the IBMCOM forum.

Appendix E: FAX and Internet addressing workaround.
______________________________________________________________________________


    Because the ATO editor's "To:" field is limited to 24 characters, it can 
    be used only for short Internet and FAX addresses.  There is a workaround
    for those recipients you send FAX or Internet messages to regularly.

    First, go online and enter the recipient's name and address in your 
    CompuServe Mail Address Book.  Enter the name on the name line, and
    enter the FAX or Internet address on the PPN line, as

           >FAX:212-345-6789
    or
           >INTERNET:JLEAH@GHOTI.LCS.MIT.EDU

    Once you have done this, you can send to those addresses through ATO by
    entering the name, preceded by an asterisk, in the "To:" field, and
    omitting the PPN in the "Id:" field.  ATO and CIS will handle the rest.
