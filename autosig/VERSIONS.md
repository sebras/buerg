# AUTOSIG version history

- 7.0b 06/25/95
  - New send box for Mail forum to allow Normal text messages (sent without B+ transfer) and Latin-1 messages (sent with B+ transfer).  Also Binary and Text files can be Mailed.  Text file mailing is particularly useful to send files to Internet addresses.  New send box also allows any Mail subject to be used, even when sending files.
  - A logoff script can be specified after a slash in the host setup "LogOn/Off SCRipt file" field.  E.g., L1.SCR/O1.SCR means L1.SCR is used for logon and O1.SCR is used for logoff.  This should help users who need special action to logoff from supplemental networks.
  - Mouse implemented as in 6.9a with one intended change: clicking on forum goes to that forum (as if letter key pressed) instead of just selecting that forum and requiring separate click or CR to go to forum.  Right button works for <Esc> on main menu.  Mouse can be placed on left/right arrows on forum menus to move to adjacent forums.
  - /T commandline switch implemented for BIOS writes.
  - Accept up to 14 characters of filename for <PgDn> at Disposition ! prompt. This allows for CompuServe's new 8-character (plus extension) filenames.
  - Adjust for new SprintNet logoff sequence.  (SprintNet no longer always says 202 DISCONNECTED.)
  - Change default hosts to run from 2400 to 28800 bps
  - Adjust for space after > in Mail address.  First > in any address with no PPN is assumed to be the delimiter.
  - Allow Join in Mail.
  - Make Mail not give error if user name not set in Mail addressbook.  It will read incoming Mail fine, but outgoing Mail will hang because waiting for sender name.
  - Only search for "Date: " for start of CompuServe Mail (will help with some of the screwy things CIS does to Mail header format).
  - Save/restore foreground/background colors.
  - Remove write to log for forums not visited in auto 1 pass.  (This was slowing down the passes on machines with slow disks.)
  - Set SEND OFF on forum entry to avoid problems with SENDs.
  - Make PgUp/PgDn/Alt-N in PC Options box simply beep instead of exit.
  - Trap error 24 on comm port reset or close, hopefully eliminating hangs at that point, like when modem is turned off.
  - Retain default forum mode settings
  - Remove TIME command when logging off from forum if logoff script specified.
  - Change B+ transfer so abort requires 5 NAKs on same block instead of 10 NAKs over length of file.  Change wording in B+ routine: "Timeout" to "Transmission delay" to be more descriptive.
  - Trap comm port device timeout and give informative message.
  - Allow program exit if modem off.
  - Set time after logout before hangup to 20 seconds.
  - Drop DTR when exiting terminal mode if not connected.
  - Port reset when opening the comm port.
  - Increase checksum speed (factor of five) for resume of B+ downloads (will help resume larger files on slow machines).
  - Change default for Alt-S in Read/View to just be forum directory.
  - Change editor character counter after <F10> to allow only 9,973 characters in each message part.
  - Mail subject corrected to allow single quotes.
  - Several small changes to detect and respond to CompuServe error messages including too many users in forum.
  - Drop back to DOS if /2/z commandline switches specified and nothing for auto 2 to do.
  - Check for unbalanced [ in To:.  Change last char to ] if needed.
  - Fix problem with Forum ! in forum entry announcements.  (There will still be a problem if Forum ! appears at the left margin.)
  - Prevent Private status of last message Read or Viewed from being carried into W function.
  - Fix overprinting problem when terminal print switch set.
  - Fix routine to turn 16550 off on exit from ATO (if ATO turned it on).
  - Fix some problems where invalid directories were causing untrapped errors.

  - change test for forum temporarily unavailable.
- 6.92 07/04/92
  - fix Mark to recognize (H)eld headers.
  - suppress REA WAI start when leaving Basic Services.
  - be more specific in checking to make sure that Mail is reached
  - allow TO: to be used in the first line of the body of a Mail message and have ATO send the subject properly.  The user still must enter * in the To: field of the send box, but will then be able to stick multiple or long addresses in the body of the message.  (Check Help Mult in Mail for info on this process.)
  - update some REA and SCA commands to new format (still can't use proper new command for QS because of need to get highest message # covered).
  - fix F so it reads in # order when HMN is N.
  - have 0 for HMN be treated as 0 rather than N.
  - abort Mark when too many headers to process all of them (now 520)
  - Alt-F in Read (or View) sends Form-Feed character to eject printer page
  - `K>ill` function on forum menu has `D>ownload` option to remove pending Download function
  - Adjust for new CIS looseness in handling INTERNET return addresses. "INTERNET:" will be accepted if that is exact beginning of From: line of incoming message.
  - Fix addressing problem with Mail messages without names
  - add Alt-S to save to arbitrary file (defaults to standard `*S` file, then holds whatever was used for last Alt-S in a given R or V operation).
  - set Sysop command uploads so they work properly in forum which does not have private messages enabled.
  - fix screen problem for sending `C>opy` and accessing PPN (done in 6.91j)
  - make Read Wait (U function) less vulnerable to CIS errors.
  - allow "Post action !" to be included in message uploads.
  - require non-blank char following > for gateway addresses in Mail.
  - fix multiple appearances of "capacity" line in incoming message display.
  - change /F so that it will send FF to printer after each message if set.
  - change all setup and autojoin routines so that Replies option is not changed.
  - switch I with A and ? with E between forum menu and forum help screen.  Make U caption more descriptive.
  - add checking for LIB:ALL in DOW script commands
- 6.91 05/25/92
  - REMOVED LINE NUMBERS in message editor.  Cursor line position is now shown before the colon in the lower right.  For example, 32:1985 means the cursor is on line 32 and the message has 1,985 characters.
  - Outgoing message files open in one window (of a multi-tasking or task-switching program) will not be wiped out by start of autopass or entry to the forum.  (Open outgoing message files *will* be wiped out if another window does R, V, S, or P functions in the same forum.)
  - corrections for script DOW checks for existing files
  - Change DEL again to accomodate another change in new forum software.
  - Add M to end of Sysop sequence to accomodate new forum software.
  - Made wait for ^P in Sysop commands smarter.
  - Added Hold command to Sysop set.  The actual Hold command (ON or OFF) must be entered in the field.
  - change CIS commands to work under new (and hopefully old) forumware
  - L (for Leave) becomes Compose
  - Change becomes CHA (new forumware should accept Change but doesn't now)
  - Different way of deleting messages (DEL and extra prompt <ugggh>)

  - Refresh $ in upper right on editor screen (if online)
  - Increase array limits (won't help much)
- 6.90 03/26/92
  - add RUN verb to script processor: the last statement in a script may be a RUN statement; it results in executing the name of the specified script, e.g. RUN NEXTPASS.
- 6.8c 03/18/92
  - public release
  - fix Alt-J so it joins forum if user is not already a member (prevents hang when initial is set)

  - slight changes to auto list menu (add J and S, change +)
  - improve COM handling at 9600 bps
  - correct use of /D to disable carrier detect logic
  - fix J on (P)rivate message so deletion deletes the message being viewed rather than the parent of the message being viewed.
  - fix DOW script command so it does a resend to create a prompt for any following MATCH or WAIT.  (Thus the 6.89 requirement to avoid those commands is removed.)
  - fix gateway reset after logoff
  - fix auto passes so no Go <page> issued between forums with same page
- 6.89 12/05/91
  - fix script DOW command so it will simply skip downloading a file when downloading the file would cause an overwrite of an existing file.  The fix requires that WAIT and MATCH *not* be used after a DOW.
  - fix script DOW command so that it continues after a file not found message from CIS
  - fix message Download function so that it traps message not found sent from CIS, locates the offending section of a stacked command line and sends the rest of the line to avoid missing messages.

    - Changed Alt-F and Alt-J so that 2 blanks will be retained after a period which was at the end of a line before the reformat or join.
    - Made <ctrl-backspace> the activation key to delete the whole word where the cursor in position.
    - Made <ctrl-T> the activation key to delete from the cursor position to the next start-of-word.  If there are no start of words to the right of the cursor, it simply deletes to the end of the line.
    - Cleaned up the display on line 24 and the send box title when Previewing a Reply.  They each now say that a reply is being edited.
    - Squeezed space out of line 24 display on replies, also requiring modifying code which generates delete command to CIS.

    - <enter> with insert off on last permissible line will trigger proper error message.
    - Insert mode toggles no longer occasionally cause line number at right of current line to blank.
    - allow To: to be empty for Email messages
- 6.16 12/07/89
  - Correct mouse with non-25-line screens
  - Correct mouse with PPN processor
  - change Email to allow replies to `>MCI:` and `>INTERNET:` addresses
  - add command line option "/L" to supply the filename extension; the extension defaults to ATO. If you supply the /Lext parameter, you can not change the file extension via the Forum Options menu. This parameter is intended for use by groups of people who use the same copy of ATO on a system. The extension could be the user's initials, e.g. /LVDB. The extension must be 3 characters.
  - Incorporated JCM (616) corrections:
    - Fix problem where Ctrl-PgDn with message shorter than scren would move cursor to bottom line of message, but would also move entire message to bottom part of screen leaving an ugly border.  Now cursor simply moves to bottom line and leaves message where it is.
    - Change ctrl-left to move cursor to next previous beginning of word (which will be beginning of current word if cursor is not already there).
    - Change F6 so that the cursor will not move off last line of message. This prevents runaway deletion of lines from bottom of message.  (Any blank lines at the bottom of the message are never saved when the message is stored.  That has been true for quite a while.)
    - Set F10 to "Send" message -- same as F4 for now, but moving toward freeing up F4.  This is to be consistent with other places where F10 is the "do it" key.  This leaves Alt-B as the only key to break the message.
    - Similarly set Alt-F10 to say "Send and save copy in <forum>.FIL"
    - Change send routine so a single leading slash on a line will never be sent.  (Double leading slashes will be left alone.) This prevents EDIT from taking the line as a command.  It prevents the user from entering an EDIT command as part of a message, but they shouldn't be doing that anyway.  I checked and LINEDIT apparently just ignores leading slashes, so I add the slash for both editors -- assuming that the LINEDIT users really want the slash to appear.
    - Tried a new wording of message asking user whether to convert reply to new message.
    - Fixed problem where user was dumped back to forum menu after sending a Reply which was converted to a message, thereby losing their place in the Read or View function.
    - Fixed conversion function so user is taken to send box to change whatever information caused the need to convert from send to new message.
    - Updated line 24 display to show the user that the reply really was converted to a message.
    - Cleaned up import a little bit so return from unsuccessful import will give at least a message and allow abort with user being taken back to message display if abort is chosen.
    - Implemented Ctrl-Backspace as delete whole word.  This should probably be substituted for Ctrl-T since ^T is not the WordStar implementation. At the moment, both of them have the same function.
    - Add period at end of "Press ENTER to continue."

    - `C>arbon`  stores the message and presents the Send Window for entering To: for another recipient
    - `R>eturn`  returns to editing
    - `K>eep`    saves a copy of the message in forum.FIL
