 --------------                                             Dec 30, 1987
 
Purpose:
 
        CISMSG copies a file which contains CompuServe (CIS) messages to
        a new file with the messages in subject or number order.
 
Format:
 
        CISMSG  [d:][path]infile[.ext]  [d:][path]outfile[.ext]
                [/nn]  [/M]  [/S]
 
Remarks:
 
        Records are read from the  file named by 'infile' and  copied to
        the file  named by  'outfile'.  Records  must end  in a carriage
        return or  linefeed, and  must be  less than  255 characters  in
        length.  The 'infile'  file name is  required.  If omitted,  the
        'outfile' name  defaults to  'MESSAGES.ALL', or  to the 'infile'
        name if just a drive for the output is supplied.
 
        Tab characters should not be present in the input file.
 
        Messages from a single section may be selected by using the  /nn
        option.  Specify a one or  two digit section number in  place of
        the nn.
 
|       By using  /S, a  separate output  file may  be created  for each
|       section which contains messages.  The output file name extension
|       becomes the section number, e.g.  MESSAGES.01 for all section  1
|       messages. This requires "files=25" in your CONFIG.SYS file.
|                                ========
 
 
        The records are  sorted into section  and subject order,  unless
        the /M option is used to specify that the messages be sorted  in
        message number order.
 
        Any  superfluous  data,  such  as  bulletins, become part of the
        preceding message.  Duplicate messages are skipped only if  they
        are identical.
 
        All available memory is used.  A maximum of 64K is used for  I/O
        buffers.  Half of  the available memory  is used for  containing
        message data.  Each message requires 32 bytes.
 
        Depending on the amount of memory available, up to 10000 records
        may be ordered.  Neither the  size of the file, nor  the lengths
        of messages, affects the maximum number of messages that can  be
        processed.
 
        For  best  performance,  place  the  input  message  file on the
        fastest disk drive, e.g.  RAM disk.

                        --------
 
        o Sort the  messages from file  IBMSW.719 on drive  A, to a  new
          file called IBMSW.XXX on drive B
 
                CISMSG A:IBMSW.719 B:IBMSW.XXX
 
 
        o Sort messages in file IBMSW.MON which is on the current drive,
          and copy to a new files called IBMSW.MON on drive B
 
                CISMSG IBMSW.MON B:
 
 
        o Select section 8 messages from file IBMNEW.MSG
 
                CISMSG IBMNEW.MSG IBMNEW.8 /8
 
 
        o Sort the messages in the file IBMSWM.ATO by message number:
 
                CISMSG IBMSWM.ATO IBMSW.MSG /M
 
 
        o Sort the messages in the file IBMCOMM.ATO into separate  files
          for each section.  The output files are named IBMCOM.nn where
          'nn' is the section number.
