Command DIRSORT
---------------

Purpose:  To sort the directory (DIR) file used by BBSWES.

Usage:	  DIRSRT  dir-name  output-filename  [/D]
		  [DIR]     [DIRSRT]	     [/C]
					     [/ca]

	The 'dir-name' is optional. It may include drive and
	path. The default is DIR.

	The 'output-filename' is optional. It may include a
	drive, path, and filename. If omitted, a file name
	of DIRSRT is used.

	The /D option specifies that the directory be sorted
	in descending order by date.

	The /C option specifies that the directory be sorted
	by the two character category field. The default sort
	order is by filename. You may use only one of the /C
	and /D options.

	To select only those file entries belonging to a
	category, supply the '/ca' switch with the two letter
	category, e.g. /GA to select all GA files. Be sure the
	letters are upper case if they are upper case in the
	directory file.

	Approximately 128K is required. At least 32 bytes per
	file entry is needed, plus 32k for file buffers.
