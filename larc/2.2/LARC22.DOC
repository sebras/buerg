  LARC Utility                                            Version 2.2
  ------------                                           Mar 8,  1989

  Purpose:

        To create the smallest possible archive files.

  Usage:
        LARC d:[\inpath\]filespec  [d:\outpath]
|                                  [/A] [/C] [/G] [/K] [/P] [/Z]
                                   [/L] [/R]

        The input drive and/or path is required and specifies the
        location of file(s) to be processed.  The inpath name is
        optional.  You may include wildcards.  The extension defaults
        to ARC.

        The output drive and path are optional. If omitted, the
        original ARC files are replaced with any smaller versions
        created by the LARC process. If supplied, all archive files
        are newly created in the output directory. This is handy
        for insuring that you get the archive file in the format
        that you want, e.g. in SEA ARC format only.

        At least two disk directories are required.  The first (from
        d:\inpath) contains the original files.  The second (the
        current drive and path) is used for temporary storage where
        all  files are extracted and re-created.  A large RAM disk
        is recommended.  Optionally, a third directory (from
        d:\outpath) is used as the destination for all new files.

        You MUST not have the d:\inpath the same as the current drive
        and path.  The current drive (and directory) is used for
        temporary work space. You can have the inpath and outpath the
        same to force replacement of all existing ARC files. The smallest
        files - in terms of bytes,  not clusters - is used.

        Use one or more of the option switches to specify the program(s)
        to be used for creating archive files:

          /A for ARCA
          /C for SEA's ARC
          /G for GSARC or PAK
          /K for PKARC
          /P for PKPAK
          /Z for PKZIP

        If none is supplied, the default is to use ARCA only.

        If an LBR library file is encountered, it is converted to
        an ARC file. You must have LUE.COM available in the DOS path.
        If you plan to just convert LBR files, use an input file
        specification of "*.LBR" to avoid unnecessary processing.
        The LBR file is not deleted unless the /L option is supplied.
        This gives you complete control of the process.

        A summary report is produced at the end of the program. It
        is normally displayed on the screen, but you can have a
        duplicate written to the file LARC.RPT by supplying the /R
        option on the command line.

        You should have ARCA, PKXARC, PKARC, PKPAK, PKZIP, PAK, LUE
        and ARC.EXE accessible from the DOS path, preferably in a RAM
        disk, depending on the options supplied pn the command line. Of
        course, you may substitute BAT files for any of those programs.


                        Operation
                        ---------

        Each ARC file is individually unpacked by PKXARC (so that
        squashed files can be processed), and then ARCed using ARC,
        PKARC, PKPAK and/or ARCA. If any of the resulting ARC files is
        smaller than the original, the original is immediately
        replaced. The original ARC file's date and time are preserved.

        Each PAK file is unpacked by the GSARC/PAK program. If /G is
        specified, a PAK file is created in place of the original
        ARC file.

        Each ZIP file is unpacked with PKUNZIP. If /Z is specified,
        a new ZIP file is created in place of the original ARC, LBR,
        or PAK file if the ZIP file is smaller.

        It takes a long time to process several archive files. Figure
        an hour for 10 megs of files on an AT.  LARC beeps when
        it is finished, and displays a summary of the files processed.

        You can eliminate squashed files by using an early version
        of PKARC, or by patching PKARC to disable squashing.

        I use LARC to process newly uploaded files. It is a brute
        force method of testing the integrity of the files, and
        results in saving disk space.

                        Examples
                        --------

     o  There are several ARC files in the directory C:\TEST; drive
        D: is an 800K RAM disk. Any smaller ARC files replace the
        existing files. Only ARC is used.

             d:|cd \
             larc c:\test\*

     o  All ARC files in the directory C:\UPLOADS are copied to a
        new directory, C:\TEST, in their smallest versions. The disk
        directory C:\WORK is the current directory and is used for
        temporarily extracting ARC files. All files in C:\WORK are
        deleted. Both ARCA and PKARC are used.

             c:|cd \work
             larc c:\uploads\* c:\test /A/P

     o  Convert all library LBR files on C:\TEST to ARC files, and
        delete the original library files. Drive d: is used for
        temporary storage.

             d:
             larc c:\test\*.lbr /l

     o  Replace existing ARC file on B:\ with the smallest ARC
        files. Drive C: is used for temporary storage.

             c:
             larc b:\* b:\ /a/p/c

                        Version History
                        ---------------

   3/15/87
        Version 1.5 corrects an overflow (error 6) problem, and adds
        another check to be sure that the temporary directory is
        different from the input and output directories. Remember,
        all files in the temporary directory are deleted.

        Also, DOS 3.1 or later is required for proper operation.
        There's no guarentee of anything, anyway.


   4/15/87
        Version 1.6 adds more checks to insure that the temporary
        directory is empty. Also, you may now press ESCape while
        LARC is running to cancel it. A check was added to stop
        processing if an error occurred creating a new ARC file

|  2/24/89
|       Version 2.1 adds internal tables for specifying the various
|       programs to be used. The defaults include ARCA, ARC, PAK,
|       PKARC, PKPAK, and PKZIP.
|  3/08/89
|       Version 2.2 corrects a problem deleting original ARC files

|       Approximately 256k of memory is required.

        Use LARC at your own risk. There is no warranty or guarentee
        that the program will work as expected.
