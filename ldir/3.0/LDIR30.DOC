LDIR Command
-----------

Purpose:   To display the files in one or all directories of a disk.

Format:    LDIR  [d:][\path]filespec]  [/?... /?]

Remarks:   If no operands are supplied, the files in the current path
           and in the current directory are displayed. You may specify
           another drive using the d: operand, and/or a path name,
           and/or a file specification. Wildcard characters * and ? are
           permitted in the filespec operand.

           All available memory is used. As many files as fit in memory
           are sorted and displayed.

           The /? refers to optional processing switches. You may use
           one or more of the following:


Sort options:

          /D   sort by file Date
          /F   sort by File name
          /N   no sorting of DIR entries
          /S   sort by file Size
          /X   sort by eXtension

File criteria:

          /A   include Attributes, e.g. S=system, R=readonly, H=hidden
          /H   include files with the Hidden attribute
          /M   display only Modified files, i.e with Archive bit off
          /P   include all Paths starting with the current directory

Display options:

          /C   Clear screen first, and after any "... more" prompts
          /W   Wait after screen full, ask for any key after 20 lines displayed
          /?   display usage syntax



Examples:
           - Display all files, in filename order, on the current drive:

                LDIR

           - Display all files in the subdirectory \TEST\PGMS on drive B:

                LDIR B:\TEST\PGMS

           - Display only those files with an extension of .COM in the
             current directory which is not a root directory:

                LDIR \*.COM

           - Display all modified files in all subdirectories on current drive
             and place the output in the file called DIRLIST on drive C:

                LDIR /M/P >C:DIRLIST

Changing defaults:

        The default option is to sort by file name. You may use DEBUG
        to permanently change this default. The bytes called FLAG1
        and FLAG2 contain the option indicators.

        Field   Offset  Option  Hex and bit values
        -----   ------  ------  -----------------------------------
        FLAG1   010D      A     01  .... ...1
                          H     02  .... ..1.
                          C     04  .... .1..
                          D     08  .... 1...
                          X     10  ...1 ....
                          F     40  .1.. ....
                          S     80  1... ....

        FLAG2   010E      M     01  .... ...1
                          W     02  .... ..1.
                          P     20  ..1. ....

        For example, to change to defaults to /A/P/D/F/W:
        FLAG1 becomes 01 + 08 + 40,  (A and D and F),
        FLAG2 becomes 02 + 20 = 22,  (W and P).

                DEBUG LDIR.COM
                -e 10d 49            (should originally be 40)
                -e 10e 22            (should originally be 00)
                -w
                -q

           Version 2.7, February 15, 1986
                Minor corrections to command line syntax checking

           Version 2.8, April 22, 1986

|          Version 3.0, June 4, 1986
|               Corrects a problem when DEBUG is used to change

|               used to read directories was not being updated.
