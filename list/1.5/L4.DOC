----------------

 Purpose:  To display the contents of an ASCII file, line by
	   line, with operator positioning commands.

 Format:   LIST	[d:][path]filename[.ext]

 Remarks:  An ASCII file of any	size may be listed.

			F1		Help

 Restrictions:
	All positioning	is relative to the current block in
	storage. The size of the block depends on the amount of
	memory available, up to	64K.

	The maximum record length currently allowed is 255.

	Logical	records	(ending	in LF and/or CR) are placed
	into the DOS screen buffer - mono or color display.

	PC-DOS Version 2.0 or later is required.

	ANSI.SYS is NOT required.

 Scanning for text:
	To scan for a character string, type a slash (/)
	followed by one or more (up to 32) characters. The
	scan text, but not the slash, is displayed on the
	command line. Only the current block is scanned.

	If the text is found, the line containing it is displayed
	as a blinking line.

	If the text is NOT found, an error message is displayed
	and the display remains unchanged. To scan the next block,
	"page" into it with PgDn or Down, and use F3 to re-scan.

 Screen attributes:
	There are three classes of attributes used. One for
	normal display lines - lines 2 to 24, another for
	special lines - lines 1 and 25, and a third for the
	background color.

	These attributes may be changed by using DEBUG:

	 at offset 11C = 09	;special lines, hi-lighted or lt.blue
	 at offset 11D = 02	;normal lines, green
	 at offset 11E = 00	;background, black

	If these values don't match, you have a different version.
