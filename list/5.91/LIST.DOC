 Command  LIST
 -------------

 Purpose:  To display the contents of an ASCII text file,  line by  line
        with the aid of scrolling, positioning and filtering commands.

 Format:   LIST  [d:][path]filename[.ext]

 Remarks:  An ASCII file of any size may be listed.

           The "filename" is optional.  If omitted, you are prompted  to
        to enter  a filename.   You may  include drive,  path, and  wild
        cards in the file name.   The first file which matches  the name
        is displayed until an end-of-file character is encountered. Each
        file which matches the "filename" may be displayed.

           LIST was  designed to  display ASCII  files.  That  is, files
        which  contain  text  and  not  binary  or  control codes.  Text
        characters  usually  range  from a  value of 32 to 127.  To view
        binary files (COM, EXE, etc), the alt-H hex dump display  option
        is available.

           Characters  below  32  (a  blank)  are  replaced with a funny
        character to indicate that a non-displayable character has  been
        encountered.  This character is an upside-down question mark.

           Characters above 127 may be valid graphic characters, and may
        be displayed if  the '8' command  is in effect.   To insure that
        characters above ASCII value 127 are not displayed, use the  '7'
        command.

           The top line of the display gives the file name, current right
        scroll offset, and the file's creation date and time. Optionally,
        a ruler may be displayed on the top line by using the alt-R keys.

           The  file  is  displayed  with  one  logical  record  on each
        80-column display line.   A logical record  ends in a  linefeed.
        The maximum logical record may  be 256 characters long.  If  the
        record exceeds 80  characters, you may  view the portion  beyond
        the 80 columns  by using the  scroll right command,  or by using
        the Wrap feature.

           The Wrap  command toggles  ON or  OFF the  wrapping of  lines
        longer than 80 characters.  With Wrap on, lines are displayed in
        their  entirety,  80  characters  per  display line.  The scroll
        -left and -right functions are disabled when Wrap is ON.

           The file may  be PRINTed as  it it displayed.   The P command
        toggles  the  printer  on  or  off.   When  first entered, the P
        command causes the current screen  to be printed.  As new  lines
        are displayed, they too are printed.  Printing may be stopped by
        entering another P command.  The PrtSc key may also be used, but
        the title and prompt lines will be printed with the lines of the
        file. Empty lines cause a line to be skipped on the printer. The
        letter P is displayed in column 80 of the top line while printing.

 Display format
 --------------

           The monitor display is defined in terms of lines and columns.
        A typical monitor can display 25 lines of 80 columns each.  LIST
        attempts to use the number of lines and columns for the monitor
        mode in use.  For example, if the monitor is in 40 column mode,
        LIST displays only 40 characters per line.

           The top line of the display is called the Status line.  The
        bottom line is called the Command line.  The remaining lines are
        called the primary display window, and are usually lines 2
        through 24.


 Status line format
 ------------------

    The Status line has the following format:

    LIST   lllll +sss mm/dd/yy hh:mm  bKMPSW  - filename

    where,

        'LIST'     is the name of this program

        'lllllll'  is the line number of the first line in the
                  display window (usually on line 2)

        '+sss'     if displayed, this is the Scroll amount, in
                  multiples of 20, corresponding to the number
                  of columns that the display has been shifted
                  to the right to view records longer than 80

        'mm/dd/yy' is the file's creation date
        'hh:mm'    is the file's creation time

        'D'       indicates that the hex Dump display option is in use
        'b'       indicates whether the 7-bit, 8-bit, or *-option is
                  in use
        'K'       indicates that the Keyboard flush option is in use
        'M'       indicates that tests for monitor retrace are not made
        'P'       indicates that Print is in use
        'S'       indicates that the C (file sharing) is in use
        'W'       indicates that the Wrap mode is in effect

 Command line format
 -------------------

    The Command line has the following format:

    command message ______ Keys: <> PgUp PgDn Q=next X=exit ?=Help

    where,

      'command' indicates the current process:

          'Command'   you are being asked to enter a command
                       enter the letter, or press the keys for
                       the action to perform

          'Reading '   the file data is being read
          'Filter  '   the file data is being formatted for display

                       line number to which the display is to be
                       positioned


      'message' may be one of:

          '*** Text not found ***'
           the Scan/Text was not found in the file

          '   *** Top of file ***'
           the first line of the file is being displayed

          '   *** End-of-file ***'
           the last line of the file is being displayed

     ctl-left-arrow  reset scroll to column 1

     alt-C           clone LIST.COM, change colors or options
                     permanently in program file
     alt-H           toggles hex dump formatted display
     alt-R           toggles display of a ruler on the top line
     alt-S           toggles file Sharing option, when off
                     files remain open until program termination


 Positioning to Lines
 --------------------

           Each displayable line of the file is assigned a line number.
        The first line is assigned line number 1.  The highest allowable
        line number is 65535.  In order to determine the last line
        number, the entire file must be read.  For this reason, the
        first time that the END (bottom) command is issued, it will take
        longer to process.

           If the Wrap option is in effect, there is one line number
        required for each 80 bytes of the file records.

           If the hex dump option is in effect, there is one line number
        required for each 16 bytes of the file.

           You may position to a specific line number by using the
        c-Home, control key and Home key.  When c-Home is entered, you
        are prompted for the line number.  Enter the 1 to 5 digit line
        number.  The display will now begin with that line number at the
        top of the screen.

           To position forward or backward, you may use the + (plus), or
        - (minus) keys.  You are prompted to enter the number of lines
        to be skipped.  The display resumes at the line number shown on
        the top (status) line, plus or minus the number of lines that
        you specified.

 Cloning procedure
 -----------------

           The screen colors, the display retrace testing (M), the file
        closing (C) and ruler (alt-R) options may be permanently set in
        the program by using the alt-C cloning function.

           For cloning to take effect, the program must be called
        LIST.COM and it must be on the current drive and in the current
|       directory. There are two versions of the LIST COM file. One is
|       the normal program. The other, which contains an 'S' as the last
|       letter of the file name, is a slightly smaller file that excludes
|       the Help screen. You may use either COM file for cloning.

           The clonable options (command toggles) are:

             M     = Mono monitor, affects retrace testing,
             alt-R = use ruler on top line,
             C     = file(s) are shared,
             alt-H = hex dump display, like the DEBUG format
             W     = Wrap long lines
|            8/7/* = display all 256 values, or 7-bit, or special cases
             K     = flush Keyboard each time a command is read


 DEBUG Information
 -----------------

           An alternative to cloning is to use DEBUG to make permanent
        changes. Here is a list of key items and their addresses:

           0126 - special lines 1 and 25 colors, default is 01 (blue)
                  Refer to a technical reference guide for the
                  attribute values for the colors that you want.
           0128 - normal lines 2 thru 24 colors, default is 02 (green)
           012A - bright color for Find/Scan, default is 0C (bright red)
           012C - options; bits 0 through 6
                   MRSD WHK.  M = mono, x'01'
                              R = ruler, x'02'
                              S = shared, x'04'
                              D = hex display, x'08'
                              W = wrap mode, x'10'
                              H = hi-bit on, x'20'
                              K = kybd flush, x'40'

                  By specifying the bit value, the option is enabled.
                  For example, to enable Shared and Retrace, specify
                  a hex value of 05.

           The letters and command keys may also be changed.  There are
        two tables involved:  WHAT and WHERE.  The WHAT table contains a
        list of one-byte keyboard codes.  The WHERE table contains a
        list of two-byte addresses.  If you really want to change the
        codes, here are the DEBUG addresses:

           0358 - *WHAT* eye catcher
           035E - list of one byte command letters and codes

           0394 - *WHERE* eye catcher
           039B - list of two byte addresses of processing routines

        NOTE: These DEBUG addresses are version dependent.

 Screen attributes
 -----------------

           The colors used for displaying the titles and main body of
        text may be changed temporarily or permanently.  To make a
        permanent change, the cloning command alt-C is used.  It
        requires that the LIST.COM program file be on the current drive
        and in the current directory.

           There are three classes of attributes used.  One for normal
        display lines - lines 2 to 24 - another for special lines -
        lines 1 and 25, and a third for the Find/Scan color.  The border
        is not changed.  The foreground color applies to the characters
        displayed.

        These color attributes may be changed by using these function keys:

          For the main body of text:

            F5 - background color
            F6 - foreground color

          For the top and bottom lines:

            F7 - background color
            F8 - foreground color


        Once you have decided upon the colors, use the alt-C key
        combination to change the LIST.COM program file.

 Scanning for text
 -----------------


           You may use  Find (\)  to search for text  regardless  of the
        case, or you may use Scan (/) to find an exact match.

           To scan for a character string, type a slash (/) followed  by
        one or more (up to 31)  characters.  The scan text, but not  the
        slash,  is  displayed  on  the  command  line.  The scan is case
        sensitive.  That is, lower case scan text will only match  lower
        lower case file text.

           While  the  program  is  searching  for  the text, the bottom
        display line is changed to say "Scanning".

           If the text is found, the line containing it is displayed  as
        a high-intensity line (bright color).

           If the text is NOT found, the bottom line (25) is changed  to
        say '*** text not found ***', and the display remains unchanged.

           To find the next occurrance of the same text,  use the A)gain
        command, or press the F3 key.

|          If the PCED keyboard enhancement program is installed, the
|       up/down cursor keys may be used to recall and edit previously
|       entered Scan/Find text.

           In a shared file environment, if the file changes while being
        listed, the file position may become invalid.  Use the HOME
        command to insure proper file synchronization, or use the C
        (shared) option.

 Filtering
 ---------

           Filtering is the term used to describe the process that LIST
        uses to format file data for displaying on a monitor. After data
        is read from a file, it is filtered. The method of filtering
        depends upon the options in effect.

           For a typical ASCII text file, the filter removes carriage
        return and line feed characters, and expands TAB characters.

           The 7, 8, and * (asterisk) commands determine whether
        characters above ASCII-127 are displayed.  If the hi-bit option
        is off (7 command), the filter strips the high order bit from
        each character.  If the hi-bit option is on (8 command), all
        characters, including graphic characters above ASCII-127, are
        displayed.

|          The * (asterisk) command displays only ASCII characters
|       below 128 (x'80'), but treats the special characters x'8A' and
|       x'8D' as line-feed and carriage-return control characters.  Any
|       other characters above 127 are ignored.

           The Wrap option causes the filtering to insure that no line
        exceeds the width of the monitor, e.g. 80 characters.

           The hex dump option (alt-H) causes the filtering to reformat
|       the file data into a DEBUG-like display format. The largest
|       file that can be "dumped" is 1 million bytes.

           Future versions of LIST will include filter options for:

                o  token BASIC
                o  sQueezed files
                o  LBR library files
                o  ARC archive files
                o  specific word processor formats
                o  user written, optionally installable filters

        NOTE: The EOF control character is ignored in this version.
