 Command  LIST
 -------------


 Purpose:
           You use LIST to display  files on your monitor, line  by line
        with the aid of scrolling, positioning and filtering commands.


 Format:
                 LIST  [d:][path]filename[.ext]


 Remarks:
           You may rename the program file to any convenient name,  such
        as  L.COM,  READ.COM,  or LIST.COM.

           Using  LIST  is  fairly  easy.   You  type  the  command LIST
        followed by  the name  of the  file that  you want  to see.  For
        example: LIST CONFIG.SYS would display the file CONFIG.SYS.

           Once the file  is displayed on  your screen, you  may use the
        cursor positioning keys to  move around and see  different parts
        of the file.  For example,  when LIST first starts, you  see the
        first 23 lines of the file.  To see the next 23 lines, or  page,
        press the PgDn key.   The PgUp key moves  you back one page  and
        shows you the  previous 23 lines.   The up-arrow and  down-arrow
        keys move it  one line at a time.  When you are finished,  press
        the ESCape key and you are returned to the DOS prompt.

           The "filename" is optional.  If omitted, you are prompted  to
        to enter  a filename.   You may  include drive,  path, and  wild
        cards in the file name.   The first file which matches  the name
        is displayed.  After that file is displayed, the next file which
        matches the "filename" may be displayed, too.

           You may also use LIST  to display piped or redirected  files.
        If you are unfamiliar with these, you may skip to the next page.

        To display a redirected file, use a < (less than symbol)  before
        the name  of the  file  and  add the  /S parameter  to the  LIST
        command.  For example:

                dir a: >xyz
                list <xyz /s

        To display a piped file,  omit the filename,  but supply the /S.

                dir a: | list /s








                                                        LIST     Page 2



           Because  files  contain  different  kinds  of data, there are
        several commands  to tell  LIST how  to display  the data.   The
        process that LIST uses to make the file data readable is  called
        filtering.  The filters in LIST can:

            - replace non-text and control characters with blanks
            - expand TAB characters
            - display line drawing characters
            - change 8-bit (W*) data to readable 7-bit text
            - display the hexidecimal values for each character


           LIST was  designed to  display ASCII  files.  That  is, files
        which  contain  text, and  not  binary  or  control codes.  Text
        characters usually  range from  a value  of 32  to 127.  To view
        binary  files  (COM,  EXE,  etc),  the  alt-H (hex dump display)
        command is available.


           Characters  below  32  (a  blank)  are  replaced with a funny
        character to indicate that a non-displayable character has  been
        encountered.  This  character is  an upside-down  question mark.
        Characters above 127 may be valid graphic characters, and may be
        displayed  if  the  '8'  command  is  in effect.  To insure that
        characters above ASCII value 127 are not displayed, use the  '7'
        command.


           The top  line of  the display  gives the  file name,  current
        right  scroll  offset,  and  the  file's creation date and time.
        Optionally, a ruler  may be displayed  on the top  line by using
        the alt-R keys.


           The  file  is  displayed  with  one  logical  record  on each
        80-column display line.   A logical record  ends in a  linefeed.
        The maximum logical record may  be 256 characters long.  If  the
        record exceeds 80  characters, you may  view the portion  beyond
        the 80 columns  by using the  scroll right command,  or by using
        the  Wrap  feature.   The  Wrap  command  toggles  ON or OFF the
        wrapping  of  lines  longer  than  80 characters.  With Wrap on,
        lines are displayed in their entirety, 80 characters per display
        line.  The scroll -left  and -right functions are  disabled when
        Wrap is ON.

           The file may  be PRINTed as  it it displayed.   The P command
        toggles  the  printer  on  or  off.   When  first entered, the P
        command causes the current screen  to be printed.  As new  lines
        are displayed, they too are printed.  Printing may be stopped by
        entering another P command.  The PrtSc key may also be used, but
        the title and prompt lines will be printed with the lines of the
        file.  Empty lines  cause a line  to be skipped  on the printer.
        The letter P  is displayed in  column 80 of  the top line  while
        printing.

                     two asterisks, e.g. **.doc

     alt-H           toggles hex dump formatted display

|    alt-L           toggle preloading of files, default is OFF
                     When the file is pre-loaded, the ending line

 Positioning to Lines
 --------------------

           Each displayable line of the file is assigned a line  number.
        The first line is assigned line number 1.  The highest allowable
        line  number  is  65535.   In  order  to determine the last line
        number, the  entire file  must be  read.  For  this reason,  the
        first time that the END (bottom) command is issued, it will take
        longer  to  process.   This  is  not  necessary  if  the file is
|       preloaded using the alt-L installation option.

           If the  Wrap option  is in  effect, there  is one line number
        required for each 80 bytes of the file's records.

           If the hex dump option is in effect, there is one line number
        required for each 16 bytes of the file.

           You  may  position  to  a  specific  line number by using the
        c-Home, Ctrl key  and Home key,  or the #  key.  When c-Home  is
        entered, you are prompted for the line number.  Enter the 1 to 5
        digit line number.   The display will  now begin with  that line
        number at the top of the screen.

           To position forward or backward, you may use the + (plus), or
        - (minus) keys.  You are  prompted to enter the number  of lines
        to be skipped.  The display resumes at the line number shown  on
        the top (status)  line, plus or  minus the number  of lines that
        you specified.

|          When you change a  filter  option,  such as Wrap,   the  line
|       numbering changes.  An attempt is made to  retain  the same file
|       position.

 Display format
 --------------

           The monitor display is defined in terms of lines and columns.
        A typical monitor can display 25 lines of 80 columns each.  LIST
        attempts to use the number of lines and  columns for the monitor
        mode in use.  For example, if the monitor is in 40 column  mode,
        LIST displays only 40 characters per line.

           The top line of the  display is called  the Status line.  The
        bottom line is called the Command line.  The remaining lines are
        called the  primary  display  window,  and are usually lines two
        through 24.


 Status line format
 ------------------

    The Status line has the following format:

     LIST   lllll nnnnnnn +sss mm/dd/yy hh:mm  - filename

    where,

        'LIST'     is the name of this program

        'lllllll'  is the line number of the first line in the
                   display window (usually on line 2)

        'nnnnnnn'  is the line number of the last record, if known

        '+sss'     if displayed, this is the Scroll amount, in
                   multiples of 20, corresponding to the number
                   of columns that the display has been shifted
                   to the right to view records longer than 80

        'mm/dd/yy' is the file's creation date
        'hh:mm'    is the file's creation time


|       Note:      The date and time  shown on the top line is  NOT  the
|              current date.  It is the date and time  that the file was
|              created.

 Screen colors
 -------------

        The screen's lines may be in any of three different colors:

                - the 'special' color for the top status line and the
                  bottom command line
                - the 'normal' color for the file's text windows
                - the 'bright' color for lines with Find/Scan text,
|                 and for the upside-down question mark in 7-bit mode

           There is a pair of function keys assigned to each color.  You
        may  use  these  function  keys  to  change  the  background and
        foreground  colors  temporarily.   To  make  the  color  changes
        permanent, you may use the cloning command (alt-C), or use DEBUG
        to modify the program file.

           The colors used  for displaying the  titles and main  body of
        text  may  be  changed  temporarily  or  permanently.  To make a
        permanent  change,  the  cloning  command  alt-C  is  used.   It
        requires that the LIST.COM program file be on the current  drive
        and in the current directory.

           The border is not  changed.  The foreground color  applies to
        the characters displayed.


        The color attributes may be changed by using these function keys:

          For the main body of text:

            F5 - background color
            F6 - foreground color

          For the top and bottom lines:

            F7 - background color
            F8 - foreground color

          For the line with Find/Scan text:

            F2 - background color
            F4 - foreground

           Once you  have decided  upon the  colors,  use the alt-C  key
        combination to change the LIST.COM program file.

 Cloning procedure
 -----------------

           The screen colors, the display retrace testing (M), the  file
        closing (C) and ruler (alt-R) options may be permanently set  in
        the program by using the alt-C cloning function.

           For  cloning  to  take  effect,  the  program  must be called
        LIST.COM and it must be on the current drive and in the  current
        directory.  There are two versions of the LIST COM file.  One is
        the normal  program.  The  other, which  contains an  'S' as the
        last letter of  the file name,  is a slightly  smaller file that
        excludes  the  Help  screen.   You  may  use either COM file for
        cloning.

           The clonable options (command toggles) are:

             M      =  Mono monitor, affects retrace testing,
             C      =  file(s) are shared,
             W      =  Wrap long lines
             8/7/*  =  display all 256 values, or 7-bit, or special cases
             K      =  flush Keyboard each time a command is read

             alt-A  =  set on if using Apxcore, off if using Double Dos
|                      or TopView, or DesqView

             alt-H  =  hex dump display, like the DEBUG format

|            alt-J  =  toggle generation of line feeds for lone CRs

|            alt-L =   set on to force preloading (reading) of entire
                       file before any lines are displayed, default is OFF.

             alt-R  =  toggle columnar ruler on top line

             alt-T  =  toggle expansion of TAB characters


        Note: Be sure you have no other copies of LIST.COM which
        are accessible (because of a filepath type of utility).

 DEBUG Information
 -----------------

           An alternative to cloning is  to use DEBUG to make  permanent
        changes.  Here is a list of key items and their addresses:

           0122 - special lines 1 and 25 colors, default is 01 (blue)
                  Refer to a technical reference guide for the
                  attribute values for the colors that you want.
           0124 - normal lines 2 thru 24 colors, default is 02 (green)
           0126 - bright color for Find/Scan, default is 0C (bright red)
           0128 - options; bits 0 through 6
                   MRSD WHK*  M = mono, retrace testing if off, x'01'
                              R = ruler, x'02'
                              S = shared, x'04'
                              D = hex display, x'08'
                              W = wrap mode, x'10'
                              H = hi-bit on, x'20'
                              K = kybd flush, x'40'
                              * = special document filtering, x'80'

           0129 - clonable options, not indicated:
|                  .PATJ .... P = Preload file if on, x'02', default is off
                              A = Apxcore if on, TV/DD/DV if off, x'04,
                                  default is for Topview/Double DOS use
                              T = expand TABs if on (default), x'08
|                             J = add LF to lone CR (default), x'10'

                  By specifying  the bit  value, the  option is enabled.
                  For example, to enable  Shared and Retrace, specify  a
                  hex value of the sum, or 01+04 = 05.


        When the Find/Scan command is used, the next line which contains
        that text is highlighted using the 'bright' color, and is placed
        in row 11 of the screen.  You can change the row by altering the
        byte at location 12A which is normally '0A'.

           The letters and command keys may also be changed.  There  are
        two tables involved: WHAT and WHERE.  The WHAT table contains  a
        list of  one-byte keyboard  codes.  The  WHERE table  contains a
        list  of  two-byte  matching  addresses.   If you really want to
        change the codes, here are the DEBUG addresses:

           0359 - *WHAT* eye catcher
           035F - list of one byte command letters and codes

           039F - *WHERE* eye catcher
           03A6 - list of two byte addresses of processing routines

        NOTE: These DEBUG addresses are version dependent.

 Scanning for text
 -----------------


           You may  use Find  (\) to  search for  text regardless of the
        case, or you may use Scan (/) to find an exact match.

           To scan for a character string, type a slash (/) followed  by
        one or more (up to 31)  characters.  The scan text, but not  the
        slash,  is  displayed  on  the  command  line.  The scan is case
        sensitive.  That is, lower case scan text will only match  lower
        lower case file text.

           While  the  program  is  searching  for  the text, the bottom
        display line  is changed  to say  "Scanning".  Pressing  any key
        while the search  is in progress  will terminate the  search and
        display the message 'Text not found' on the bottom line.

           If the text is found, the line containing it is displayed  as
        a high-intensity line (bright color).

           If the text is NOT found, the bottom line (25) is changed  to
        say '*** text not found ***', and the display remains unchanged.

           To find the next occurrance of the same text, use the  A)gain
        command, or press the F3 key.

           If the  PCED keyboard  enhancement program  is installed, the
        up/down cursor keys  may be used  to recall and  edit previously
        entered Scan/Find text.

           In a shared file environment, if the file changes while being
        listed,  the  file  position  may  become invalid.  Use the HOME
        command  to  insure  proper  file  synchronization, or use the C
        (shared) option.

 Filtering
 ---------

           Filtering is the term used to describe the process that  LIST
        uses to  format file  data for  displaying on  a monitor.  After
        data  is  read  from  a  file,  it  is  filtered.  The method of
        filtering depends upon the options in effect.

           For a typical  ASCII text file,  the filter removes  carriage
        return and line feed characters, and expands TAB characters.

           The  7,  8,  and  *  (asterisk)  commands  determine  whether
        characters above ASCII-127 are displayed.  If the hi-bit  option
        is off (7  command), the filter  strips the high  order bit from
        each character.   If the  hi-bit option  is on  (8 command), all
        characters, including  graphic characters  above ASCII-127,  are
        displayed.

           The * (asterisk) command displays only ASCII characters below
        128 (x'80'), but treats  the special characters x'8A'  and x'8D'
        as line-feed and carriage-return control characters.  Any  other
        characters above 127 are treated as spaces.

           The Wrap option causes the  filtering to insure that no  line
        exceeds the width of the monitor, e.g. 80 characters.

           The hex dump option (alt-H) causes the filtering to  reformat
        the file  data into  a DEBUG-like  display format.   The largest
        file that can be "dumped" is 1 million bytes.

           An attempt is made to retain the file position when switching
        from normal to hex-dump  display, but due to  filtering changing
        record lengths,  the hex  display may  begin before  the current
        record.

        NOTE:   The  EOF  control character is  ignored in this version.

 Update history
 --------------

 There is a new version  of LIST made available frequently.  If the new
 features or corrections do not interest you, stay with the version you
 have. The complete version history is now kept in a another file.

 Lines beginning with | denote changes to the latest version.

        Version 6.0a thru 6.0e, August 30, 1986
            - corrections to last line number
            - correct disappearing EGA/EGD cursor (?)
            - correct test for TopView according to Hersey
            - correct display after change to 43-line mode
            - correct detection of EGA number of lines

        Version 6.0f, August 31, 1986
            - correct problem with 8 command, always stripping hibit

        Version 6.0g, Sept 4, 1986
            - cosmetic corrections to Help screen
            - increase data buffer to reduce "jumpy" display
            - remove some tweaking of the cursor shape
            - default to retrace testing off (M on)
            - improve readability of binary files in ASCII display mode
              by changing handling of EOF character; this also solves
              a problem with files whose last record does not contain
              a cr/lf. Remember, LIST expects "records" to have CR and/or LF.

        Version 6.0h, Sept 17, 1986
            - correct alt-F looping when invalid filespec entered
            - correct Wrap failing if W ON was cloned
            - more fussing with the EGA cursor, nothing can be done
              about colors/pallete resetting when changing modes
            - correct value of last line number when toggling Wrap
            - notes: the default for preload (alt-P) is OFF, alt-P
              is a toggle; the default of retrace testing in ON and
              may result in snow on some color monitors.

|       Version 6.0i, Sept 28, 1986
|           - Added alt-X to exit with original screen displayed
|           - Added alt-A as A, and alt-L as L in "Options:" line display
|           - Added F9 command to find previous occurance of text
|           - Compensated for old Sigma EGA ROM (pre 1.06)
|           - Changed alt-P to alt-L; preload option toggle

|       Version 6.0j, Oct 13, 1986
|           - Added alt-J to toggle the generation of line feeds (LF)
|             for lone carriage returns (CR). Makes easier viewing of
|             files which use backspace, or over printing, to emphasize
|             a line.
|           - Corrected the handling of ESCape during Scan/Find
