Introduction


    You use LIST to display files on your monitor, line by line with the
    aid of scrolling, positioning and filtering commands.

    LIST PLUS has many new  commands which go beyond usual  file viewing
    and browsing.  We will  explain how LIST is  used, and then how  the
    new file management commands are used.

    Before going  into all  of the  ways in  which LIST  can be  used to
    display files, let's look at  the three different varieties of  LIST
    so that you understand the capabilities of each.  Then, we'll go  on
    and define certain terms  like: redirection, piping, and  filtering.
    In this way, you will better understand how you can use these things
    with LIST.


Installation

    There are three varieties of the  LIST program on the disk that  you
    received (or in the file  that you downloaded).  This allows  you to
    pick the version of LIST that is right for you, and to configure  it
    to be exactly the way YOU want it to be.

    Decide which of the LIST programs you would like to use and copy the
    .COM file to your working disk, or into a subdirectory on your  hard
    disk.  Selecting a directory that is in your PATH will allow you  to
    use LIST from anywhere on your system.

    You may  rename the  program file  to any  convenient name,  such as
    L.COM,  READ.COM,  LST.COM  or  leave  it as LIST.COM.  For example,
    place the distribution disk into drive A and enter the commands:

            A:
            COPY LISTP.COM C:\L.COM

    to copy  the Plus  version to  the root  directory of  your C drive,
    renaming the program to L.COM in the process.

Printing the manual

    To print the documentation, set your printer for six lines per inch,
    and 10 characters per inch.   Then, use the DOS PRINT  command.  For
    example,

                        PRINT LIST.DOC

    You may also  print out the  documentation by using  redirection and
    entering:

                        TYPE LIST.DOC > LPT1

    Better yet, use LIST to print the manual.  Enter

                        LIST LIST.DOC

    then press the Ctrl and P keys at the same time.

Varieties of LIST.COM



        - LISTS.COM     small version

          - runs in about 30k
          - limited to smaller files (around 600kb),
          - excludes the Alt-X (screen saving) function
          - excludes the Alt-G (goto DOS) function
          - the Help screen is minimal.



        - LISTR.COM      regular version

          - runs in about 80K
          - handles files up to 16 mb
          - excludes the Alt-V (file selection) function
          - excludes the Alt-I (insert filename) function
          - the Alt-W (windowing function) is minimal, i.e. you get two
            equal sized windows; there is no ability to change window
            dimensions



        - LISTP.COM     PLUS version  (supplied as LIST.COM)

          - plus Alt-V file selection menu
          - plus file management functions like copy and delete
          - plus Alt-I hypertext-like file selection
          - plus a secondary help screen for the "special" functions
          - plus the Ctrl-T telephone dialer



    The documentation file is marked  with | before new and  changed
    lines.  It is marked  with a double asterisk  ** for LIST PLUS
    only features.








WARNING:  LIST PLUS (LISTP.COM), HAS THE ABILITY TO *DELETE*
                   FILES FROM YOUR SYSTEM!!


IF YOU ELECT TO USE LIST PLUS, PLEASE READ THE SECTION ON THE FILE SELECTION
MENU FOUND LATER ON IN THIS MANUAL.

Definition of DOS terms
______________________________________________________________________________



DOS Redirection

    The output of a  DOS command can be  "redirected" to a device  other
    than  the  standard  output  device,  which  is  in  most cases, the
    monitor.  This is done simply by entering the command, followed by a
    ">" and then the name of the desired device.  For example.

    If you type "DIR > FILE.LST" you will see nothing on your screen and
    then suddenly your  DOS prompt will  reappear.  What happened?   The
    "output" of the DIR command was "redirected" to the file, FILE.LST.

    In the same manner, you  could enter the following command  and send
    the contents of FILE.LST to your printer, like so: "TYPE FILE.LST  >
    LPT1"

    The ">" symbol stands for  redirection of output to another  device.
    Broken down simply, the following command is saying:

                    DIR            >       FILE.LST
          (send output of this)  (TO)   (This device, which is a file)

    By the same token, you can also redirect "input" to a DOS command or
    a program like SORT  by using the "<"  symbol.  Here is an  example:
    "SORT  <  FILE.LST"  This  command  would  take  the  information in
    FILE.LST  and  "redirect"  it  into  SORT.   For more information on
    redirection, you  may want  to consult  a DOS  manual or  other such
    reference.


DOS Filters

    FILTERS are  commands, or  programs, that  read data  from an  input
    device, and  then rearranges  or "filters"  the data  before it then
    outputs the  filtered information  to an  output device.   DOS comes
    with several "filters", one of which is SORT.  The following command
    would sort the file in alphabetical order.

                                SORT < FILE.LST

    You are redirecting the file,  FILE.LST through the SORT filter  and
    it is rearranging the file.  Taking what you know about  redirection
    and  filters,  you  could  now  send  your  alphabetical list to yet
    another  file  by  entering:  SORT  <  FILE.LIST  > ALPHA.LST, which
    redirects FILE.LST into the SORT "filter" and then redirects the new
    output  to  the  file  ALPHA.LST.   LIST  also has some very helpful
    "filters" built  right into  it and  we'll discuss  these later  on.
    Simply keep in mind that when  you use a "filter" it will  rearrange
    or alter the  information into a  form that is  more presentable, or
    useful, to you.

______________________________________________________________________________


DOS Pipes

    Pipes are  quite similar,  in some  ways, to  redirection.  They are
    "connections" between two programs or two commands or a command  and
    a program.   Pipes take  data that  is output  from one  program and
    redirect it as input to a second program.  The DOS symbol for a pipe
    is the vertical bar "|".  To redirect the output from one program or
    command to another, you simply type the first command followed by  a
    vertical bar and  then followed by  the second command.   Here is an
    example of piping.

                                DIR | FIND "-88"

    This command tells DOS to send the output of the DIR command,  which
    you would normally see on the  screen, and send it through the  FIND
    filter.  FIND  would be  searching each  line for  the string "-88".
    Only the files in the current directory that have a 1988 date  stamp
    would be displayed on the screen!  You can use more than one  "pipe"
    in a command.  Take this final example:

                       DIR | FIND "-88" | SORT/+14 > PRN

    A "pipe" takes the  output of the DIR  command and converts it  into
    input for the FIND  filter.  Then, a second  "pipe" is used to  send
    the output from FIND as input  to the SORT filter.  As a  last step,
    output from  SORT is  redirected to  the printer!   What would  this
    command do??   It would  take the  DIR of  the current directory and
    pipe it through the FIND filter, looking for files created in  1988.
    Then the next pipe would SORT that information, sorting the files by
    SIZE (the 14th column of each line) and then send the output to  the
    printer.  For  more information  on PIPES,  consult a  DOS manual or
    other reference.

    Now that you have  a basic understanding of  redirection, filtering,
    and piping, we will go on to discuss the command line of LIST.

Command line
______________________________________________________________________________



Command line syntax

    The command line format is:


        LIST [filespec...filespec] [/switches]


    You may supply  one or more  file specifications (filespecs).   LIST
    will display  each file  which has  a filename  matching one  of the
    filespecs.  If you  do not supply  one, LIST will  prompt you for  a
    filespec, or present you with a file selection menu.



Command line switches

                /S       indicates viewing a piped or redirected file

                /J       sets Junk filter on
                /7       sets 7-bit display
                /8       sets 8-bit display
                /*       sets star filter on

                /W       sets Wrap on
                /H       sets Hex dump mode
                /L       sets pre-Loading on
                /M       allows use of a mouse for moving the cursor

                /Ftext   tells LIST to Scan for 'text' immediately

    The command line switch character is normally a slash, "/", but LIST
    will use whatever  character that is  defined to DOS  as the command
    line switch character, e.g. a  dash, "-".  Depending on your  needs,
    you could load LIST using  any of these command line  switches, such
    as:

               LIST MYFILE.TXT /W   which would set Word Wrap ON.

               LIST MYFILE.TXT /J   which turns on the JUNK filter

How to use LIST
______________________________________________________________________________

Starting LIST


    To  start  LIST,  you  type  the  command  LIST,  at the DOS prompt,
    followed by  the name(s)  of the  files that  you want  to see.  For
    example:


          C:>LIST CONFIG.SYS        (displays file CONFIG.SYS)

          C:>LIST *.DOC    (displays all DOC files in current directory)


    The "filename" is optional.  If  omitted, LIST PLUS will bring  up a
    display of ALL  files and subdirectories  in the current  directory.
    You may use  the cursor keys  to highlight the  file that you  would
    like to work  on and press  ENTER.  Or, you  may highlight any  sub-
    directory entry and and press ENTER to change to that subdirectory.


    You  may  also  use  LIST  to  display piped or redirected files.  A
    discussion of redirection, piping, and filtering is at the beginning
    of this manual.

    To display a redirected file, use a < (less than symbol) before  the
    name of the file that was redirected and add the /S parameter to the
    LIST command.

    For example, the output of the DIR command can be written to a  file
    called XYZ, and then LIST can be instructed to read that file.

                dir a: >xyz
                list <xyz /s

    To see a piped file, omit the filename, but supply the /S.

                dir a: | list /s

    Or, to LIST a file within an ARC archive:

                ARC /p arcname.arc filename.ext | list /s
                                - or -
                ARCE arcname filename.ext /p | list /S

    Here,  the  ARC   or  ARCE  program   is  invoked  to   extract  the
    'filename.ext' file.   The /P  switch for  these programs  sends the
    output to the  standard output device,  and this output  is piped to
    LIST.

    Once the file is  displayed on your screen,  you may use the  cursor
    positioning keys to move around and see different parts of the file.
    There are also commands to search for text, print, split the screen,
    display  other  files,  change  colors,  change  the way the data is
    displayed, and many other operations.

How to use LIST
______________________________________________________________________________

Exiting LIST


    There are several ways  to exit LIST depending  on how you want  the
    screen to look.

    The F10 command returns you to DOS with the DOS prompt on the bottom
    line.  The  last page  that was  displayed by  LIST is  left on  the
    screen.

    The ESCape key also returns you to DOS without changing the  screen.
    In LIST PLUS, the ESCape key is also used to cancel an operation, or
    to exit file selection menu.

    The X command  returns you to  DOS and clears  the screen.  The  DOS
    prompt is on the top line of the screen.

    The Alt-X command uses the screen saving feature.  It returns you to
    DOS and displays the screen that you had before LIST was run.


  Entering Commands

    You enter  commands by  pressing a  single key,  or a combination of
    keys.  There  are often  several ways  to perform  the same function
    with different keys.  For example, D and PgDn both perform a  scroll
    down one page function.   This lets you pick  the keys that you  are
    most accustomed to.

    When  you  press  keys,  they  are  entered  into a keyboard buffer.
    Holding down a key can put many copies of that key into the  buffer.
    This means that when you let up  on a key, the program can still  be
    processing input from the keyboard buffer.  For example, by  holding
    down the PgDn key, LIST scrolls down one page for each time the PgDn
    key is placed in the keyboard  buffer.  When you let up on  the key,
    the buffer may not yet be empty and LIST will continue to page down.
    To make  LIST stop  when you  let up  on a  key, you  use the  Alt-K
    key-ahead toggle.

    Keyboard enhancement utilities,  such as PCED,  may also change  the
    way that LIST reads the keyboard.  With PCED, for example,  pressing
    the ESCape key at a prompt is different.  You do not see the /  that
    DOS normally sends when you cancel an input line.

How to use LIST
______________________________________________________________________________

Display Format

    The monitor  display is  defined in  terms of  lines and columns.  A
    typical  monitor  can  display  25  lines  of 80 columns each.  LIST
    attempts to use the number of lines and columns for the monitor mode
    in use.  For  example, if the  monitor is in  132 column mode,  LIST
    displays 132 characters per line.   If the monitor is set  for other
    than 25 lines, such as 35, 43, or 50 lines, LIST displays that  many
    lines per screen.

    If  you  use  the  Alt-E  command  to  change EGA/VGA modes, the EGA
    palette,  cursor,  and  other  settings  are  set to the DOS default
    values.  LIST does not preserve fonts or palettes.

    The top line of the display  is called the Status line.  The  bottom
    line is called the Command line.  The remaining lines are called the
    primary display window, and are usually lines two through 24.

  Status Line Format

    The Status line has two formats. The default format is:

旼컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴커
 LIST   lllll nnnnnnn +sss mm/dd/yy hh:mm  - filename                 
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴켸
        where,

        'LIST'     is the name of this program

        'lllllll'  is the line number of the first line in the primary
                   display window (under the status line)

        'nnnnnnn'  is the line number of the last record of the file;
                   if the last record of the file has not been read,
                   this field is blank

        '+sss'     if displayed, this is the Scroll amount, in multiples
                   of 10, corresponding to the number of columns that
                   the display has been shifted to the right to view
                   records longer than 80

        'mm/dd/yy' is the file's creation date (not today's date)
        'hh:mm'    is the file's creation time (not today's time)

        'filename' is the name of the file you are currently viewing


    Note: The date  and time shown  on the top  line is NOT  the current
    date.  It is the date and time that the file was created.

          Thus, the Status Line could look like this:
旼컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴커
 LIST      70  2153  +20    09-02-89 18:12     LIST.DOC               
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴켸

    By using the Alt-R ruler toggle, the top status line becomes:

쩟쩟태쩟01쩟쩟태쩟02쩟쩟태쩟03쩟쩟태쩟04쩟쩟태쩟05쩟쩟태쩟06쩟쩟태쩟07쩟

  Command Line Format


The Command line has two formats.  The default format is:

旼컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴커
 Command                      Keys: ^v-><- PgUp PgDn F10=exit F1=Help 
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴켸

and the optional format after using the Alt-Z toggle is:

Scrolling


    You view different parts of the file by scrolling.  That is, you use
    the cursor  positioning keys  up, down,  left and  right to move the
    display one  increment in  that direction.   For example,  press the
    down  arrow  key  to  move  the  display  one line in the file, i.e.
    display the next line in the file.


    The PgDn and PgUp  cursor keys move the  display one full screen  in
    either direction.


    Rather than press the up and  down keys once for each line,  you may
    use  continuous  scrolling.   Use  the  C  key  to toggle continuous
    scrolling on or off.  The default is off.  When toggled on, pressing
    the up or down arrow keys results in a moving display.  For example,
    when  you  press  the  down  arrow,  the  next  line  of the file is
    displayed automatically  every second,  or so.   It is  like holding
    down the arrow key.  To stop the continuous scroll, press the  space
    bar.


    The speed of the continuous scroll can be adjusted by pressing the +
    (plus) or - (minus) key while  the display is moving.  The plus  key
    makes  the  display  move  faster,  and  the minus key makes it move
    slower.  You can save the  speed value by using the  cloning command
    (see Configuring LIST, Cloning, later on in this documentation.


        Summary of scrolling commands:

            right arrow - move display right 10 columns
            left arrow  - move display left 10 columns

            down arrow  - display next line of file
            up arrow    - display previous line of file

            PgUp key    - display previous "page", 23 (or 41) lines back
            PgDn key    - display next "page", 23 (or 41) lines ahead

            C key       - turns continuous scrolling on or off
            spacebar    - or any key, interrupts continuous scrolling
            + (plus)    - makes continuous scroll incrementally faster
            - (minus)   - makes continuous scroll slower

Positioning to Lines


    Each displayable line  of the file  is assigned a  line number.  The
    first line is  assigned line number  1.  The highest  allowable line
    number is 16 million.

    In order to  determine the last  line number of  a file, the  entire
    file must be  read.  For this  reason, the first  time that the  END
    (bottom) command is issued, it will take longer to process.  This is
    not necessary if  the file has  been completely read  (see the Alt-L
    preloading option).

    If the Wrap option is in  effect, there is one line number  required
    for each 80 bytes of the file's records.  Thus, the line number does
    not represent the actual number of lines in the file.

    If  the  hex  dump  option  is  in  effect, there is one line number
    required for  each 16  bytes of  the file.   For example, an 80-byte
    line will be displayed as 5 lines.

    You may position to a  specific line number by using  the Ctrl-Home,
    or the # key.  When Ctrl-Home  is entered, you are prompted for  the
    line number.   Enter the  line number.   The display  will now begin
    with that line number at the top of the screen.

    To position  forward or  backward, you  may use  the +  (plus), or -
    (minus) keys.  You are prompted to  enter the number of lines to  be
    skipped.  The display  resumes at the  line number shown  on the top
    (status) line, plus or minus the number of lines that you specified.

    When you change  a filter option,  such as Wrap,  the line numbering
    changes.  An attempt is made  to retain the same file  position, but
    the file may be repositioned at the top.

    You may also reposition to the last "active" line by using the Alt-Y
    bookmark command.   The last  active line  is one  displayed after a
    Scan or Find command, or marked using the Alt-M or Alt-B commands.


    Summary of positioning commands:

        Ctrl-HOME, or #  - Prompts for exact line number to display

        + (plus)         - Prompts for the number of lines to skip
                           for positioning further ahead in the file

        - (minus)        - Prompts for the number of lines to skip
                           for positioning to an earlier line

        Alt-Y            - Reposition to the last "active" line

Filtering


    Filtering is the term used to describe the process that LIST uses to
    format file data  for displaying on  a monitor.  After  data is read
    from a file, it is  filtered.  The method of filtering  depends upon
    the options in effect.   LIST is fastest with no filter options set.

    For a typical  ASCII text file,  the filter removes  carriage return
    and line feed characters, and expands TAB characters.

    Because files  contain different  kinds of  data, there  are several
    commands to  tell LIST  how to  display the  data.  The process that
    LIST uses to make the  file data readable is called  filtering.  The
    filters in LIST can:

            o  replace non-text and control characters with blanks
            o  expand TAB characters
            o  display line drawing characters
            o  change 8-bit (W*) data to readable 7-bit text **
            o  display the hexidecimal values for each character
            o  remove "junk", such as control codes and backspaces

           **  W* is an abbreviation for WordStar (tm) formatted files
               which contain 'high-bit' characters. Using the '*' filter
               makes these files easier to read.

    LIST was designed primarily to display ASCII files;  that is,  files
    which  contain  text,  and  not  binary  or  control  codes.    Text
    characters, like A-Z and 0-9,  are in the 7-bit range.  Binary files
    like .COM and .EXE files, contain the full range of 8-bit characters
    and the  Alt-H (hex dump display)  command is available  for viewing
    them.

    Characters  above  127  (the  8-bit  range)  may  be  valid  graphic
    characters, and may  be displayed if  the '8' command  is in effect.
    To insure that characters above  ASCII value 127 are NOT  displayed,
    use the '7' command to limit the display to characters in the  7-bit
    range.


  Wrap Filter

    The file is displayed with one logical record on each display  line:
    usually 80 characters.  A logical record ends in a linefeed and  may
    be up to  910 characters long.   If a record  exceeds 80 characters,
    you may view the portion beyond  the 80 columns by using the  scroll
    right command, or by using  the Wrap feature.  The Wrap  (W) command
    toggles ON or OFF the  wrapping of lines longer than  80 characters.
    With Wrap on, lines are  displayed in their entirety, 80  characters
    per  display  line.   The  scroll  left  (arrow)  and  right (arrow)
    functions are disabled when Wrap is ON.

Filtering


  Hi-bit Filter

    The 7,  8, and  * (asterisk)  commands determine  whether characters
    above  ASCII-127  are  displayed.   If  the  hi-bit option is off (7
    command), the filter strips the high order bit from each  character.
    If the hi-bit  option is on  (8 command), all  characters, including
    graphic characters above ASCII-127, are displayed.


  Star Filter

    The  star  (*  or  asterisk)  command displays only ASCII characters
    below 128 (x'80'), but treats the special characters x'8A' and x'8D'
    as  line-feed  and  carriage-return  control  characters.  Any other
    characters above 127 are treated as spaces, and control codes  below
    ASCII-26 are replaced by blanks.


  Junk Filter

    The  Alt-J  command  toggles  the  "junk"  filter which insures that
    carriage  returns  in  the  file  also  result in a new line.  Also,
    backspace  characters  result  in  "backing  up"  the display by one
    position.   This   allows  more   readability  of   files  that  use
    backspacing to emphasize, or over-write, characters.


  Hex Format Filter

    The hex  dump option  (Alt-H) causes  the filtering  to reformat the
    file data into a DEBUG-like  display format.  The largest file  that
    can be displayed in Hex is 4 million bytes.

    An attempt is made to  retain the file position when  switching from
    normal to  hex-dump display,  but due  to filtering  changing record
    lengths, the hex display may begin before the current record.


                Summary of filtering commands:

        8       show all characters as-is
        7       strip the hi-bit from each character
        *       use the star filter to remove control characters
                and some special word processor characters

        Alt-J   use the "junk" filter
        Alt-H   use the "hex" filter to display in hex dump format
        Alt-T   expand TAB control characters
        Alt-W   wrap long lines to fit on screen

Scanning for text


    There are three ways  to initiate a search  for text.  First is  the
    Find (\ or F) command.  Use this command to search for text  without
    regard to the case (upper or  lower) of the letters.  Second is  the
    Scan (/ or S) command.  Use  this command to search an exact  match.
    That is, the search is case sensitive.

    The third way to initiate a  search for text is with the  /F command
    line switch.  With it, you supply  the text to search for, and  LIST
    begins the search before displaying the file, and before asking  for
    commands.  The search continues  through all selected files  until a
    match is found, or the last file has been searched.  This search  is
    case sensitive.

    Each search begins at  the line displayed on  the top of the  screen
    and proceeds in a forward direction until the end of file.  You  may
    start a search that goes backwards rather than forwards by using the
    ` (left quote) key instead of Find (\), or by using ' (right  quote)
    instead of Scan (/).

    To enter the Scan search text, type a slash (/) followed by up to 31
    characters.  The Scan  text is displayed  on the command  line.  The
    Scan is  case sensitive.   That is,  lower case  Scan text will only
    match lower case file text.

    While the program is searching for the text, the bottom display line
    is changed to say "Looking".   Pressing ANY key while the  search is
    in progress will terminate the search and display the message  'Text
    not found' on the bottom line.

    If the  text is  found, the  line containing  it is  displayed as  a
    high-intensity line (bright color) in  the middle of the screen  The
    line where the found text is displayed depends on the setting of the
    "Find Row" (see Configuration section).

    The display is scrolled left or right, as needed, so that the  found
    text is visible.

    If the text is  NOT found, the command  line is changed to  say '***
    Text not found ***', and the rest of the display remains unchanged.

    To  find  the  next  occurrence  of  the  same  text, use the A)gain
    command, or press the  F3 key.  If you  wish to continue the  search
    through all of the remaining files, use the Alt-A command.  To  find
    the previous occurrence, press the F9 key.

    If the a keyboard enhancement  program, such as PCED, is  installed,
    the up/down cursor  keys may be  used to recall  and edit previously
    entered Scan/Find text.

    In  a  shared  file  environment,  if  the  file changes while being
    listed, the file position may become invalid.  Use the HOME  command
    to  insure  proper  file  synchronization,  or  use the Alt-S (share
    files) command again.

______________________________________________________________________________

Marking and Extracting Lines


    There are two ways that lines can be extracted from a file:

              o  with the P (print) and Alt-P (print marked) commands,
              o  with the Alt-D (dump data) and Alt-O commands.

    The  lines  to  be  extracted  are  either  the current lines on the
    screen,  or  lines  that  you  have  marked with the Alt-M and Alt-B
    commands.

    To mark  lines, you  use either  the Alt-M  or Alt-B  commands.  The
    Alt-M command marks the top line on the screen, and Alt-B marks  the
    bottom line on the screen.  You  can use either or both commands  to
    mark the  starting and  ending lines  (in the  range of  lines to be
    extracted).  The marked lines are displayed in reverse video.

    After you have marked  a range of lines,  you use the Alt-P  (print)
    command to print all of the marked lines.  Or, you can use the Alt-D
    (dump  data)  command  to  write  those  lines to a file.  The Alt-D
    command asks you for a file name.  If the file does not exist, a new
    one is created.  If the file already exists, the extracted lines are
    added (appended) to the file.

    For example, you would like to have LIST filter out all of the  junk
    in a file, and then write a  new file.  To do this, you might  enter
    the following sequence of commands:

                list TESTDATA           ... display your TESTDATA file
                Alt-J                   ... filters out the junk
                Alt-M                   ... marks line 1 (top line)
                END                     ... positions to end of file
                Alt-B                   ... marks the bottom line
                                                     (last line)
                Alt-D                   ... dumps data to a file
                TESTDATE.NEW            ... you enter the new file name
                Alt-X                   ... quit and return to DOS


    Once you have marked  a range of lines,  use of Alt-M or  Alt-B does
    not reset the entire line range.  The first or last marked line  may
    change,  but  both  do  not  change.   Using  Alt-M again expands or
    contracts the range appropriately.  If the new line for  Alt-M/Alt-B
    is before the top mark, the top  mark is moved.  If the new line  is
    after the bottom mark, the bottom mark is changed.  If the new  line
    is within  the currently  marked range,  Alt-M moves  the top mark -
    contracts the range - and Alt-B moves the bottom mark.


    Use the Alt-U command to unmark lines, especially after Alt-D (dump)
    to be sure.

Printing


    The file may be PRINTed as it is displayed, in its entirety, or from
    a range of lines that you  mark.  If the printer is not  online, you
    will receive an error message, and nothing will be printed.

    The P command  toggles the printer  on or off.   When first entered,
    the P command causes the current screen to be printed.  As new lines
    are displayed, they too are printed.  For example, pressing the down
    arrow will display and print the next line of the file.

    Printing may be  stopped by entering  another P command.   The PrtSc
    key may also be used, but the title and prompt lines will be printed
    with the lines of the file.  Empty lines cause a line to be  skipped
    on the  printer.  The  capital letter  P is  displayed on the status
    line while printing if the bottom status line is set to show TOGGLES.

    The Ctrl-P command prints the file in its entirety.

    The Ctrl-F command  sends a form  feed to the  printer.  The printer
    may be the LPT1 or PRN device.

    The Alt-P command prints only lines that have been marked.

Displaying multiple files


    You can display more than one  file at a time.  LIST keeps  track of
    up to 32 files at a  time.  You supply the filenames in  the command
    line,  through  the  Alt-F  (get  new filespec) command, through the
    Alt-I  (insert  filespec)  command,  and  through  the  Alt-V   file
    selection menu.

    You  can  specify  up  to  16  filespecs  on the command line.  Each
    filespec can contain wildcards.  Thus, several files can be selected
    via the command line.  For example,

                          LIST *.DOC  *.TXT

    will display all files with an extension of DOC and TXT.

    To display the next file, you use the Q or Ctrl-PgDn command.   When
    the last file has been displayed, you can exit LIST by using the  X,
    F10, ESCape, or Alt-X commands, depending on how you want the screen
    to look when LIST ends.

    To display  the previous  file, you  use the  Ctrl-PgUp (control and
    PgUp keys together).  LIST can keep  track of up to 32 files  at one
    time.  The line number for each file is remembered.


    The Alt-F asks you for a new  file name, and you may enter a  simple
    file name, or  one that includes  wild cards.  These  new file names
    are added to the table of filenames that LIST keeps.  Thus, you  can
    use Alt-F for several different filenames, and use the Ctrl-PgDn and
    Ctrl-PgUp commands to move among them.

    The Alt-I command  allows you to  select a filespec  that is in  the
    file you are  viewing.  You position  the cursor to  the filespec on
    the  screen,  and  press  enter  to  add  it to the list of files to

How to use LIST
______________________________________________________________________________

Windows


    LIST can  display data  in one  or two  parts of  the screen  called
    windows.   The  Alt-W  command  toggles  this  split  screen   mode.
    Entering Alt-W while the screen  is split restores the display  to a
    single, full sized display.

    In the regular version, the screen is split in the middle.  The  top
    half of the screen remains the same, and the bottom half becomes the
    part of the screen where files are displayed.  Thus, the top  window
    becomes a scratch pad.

    In the LIST PLUS version, you are allowed to split the screen at any
    point.  After entering Alt-W, you  are asked to position the  cursor
    to the spot where the screen  will be split.  By placing the  cursor
    in column 1, you can adjust how  many lines will be used by the  top
    and bottom windows.  This would  be a vertical, or one  window above
    the other, split.

    By positioning the cursor to the top line with the HOME key, you can
    then use the left  and right arrow keys  to adjust how wide  each of
    the windows is to be.   This would be a horizontal,  or side-by-side
    split.

    You may display  a different file  in each window,  and move between
    them.  You use the Ctrl-V command  to switch from one window to  the
    other.  You may also use the Review commands to display a  different
    file in the second window.

    Each window uses different colors.   You can use the color  commands
    to set the colors that you  like, and then use the Alt-C  command to
    save them.


Telephone dialer

    LIST has a simple telephone dialer function.  It allows you to point
    to a telephone number that is  displayed on the screen, and to  send
    dialing commands to your modem on COM1.


    You use the  Ctrl-T command to  start the dialer.   You position the
    cursor, with the arrow  keys, to the start  of the phone number  and
    press enter.  The phone number  may contain any character, but  must
    end with a blank.

    If the phone rings, you may pick up your telephone.  Otherwise,  you
    may press <enter> to return to viewing the file, <spacebar> to  dial
    the number again, or ESCape to hang up and stop dialing.

    The Ctrl-H command hangs up the telephone.

DOS considerations
______________________________________________________________________________


File Sharing

    LIST uses two techniques for allowing you to share files with  other
    processes, such as programs running under multi-tasking systems,  in
    other windows, or on networks.

    The first technique is called  "file closing" and is enabled  by the
    Alt-S commands.  This forces LIST to close the viewed file unless it
    needs to  read from  the file.   If enough  memory is available, the
    entire file  may be  loaded once  and thus  leave the  file free for
    exclusive access by other processes.

    The second technique is called "file sharing".  It is a function  of
    DOS and requires  DOS version 3.0  or later.  LIST  opens the viewed
    files with a DENY NONE request.  This allows other processes to read
    and write to the  file if they do  not request exclusive use  of the
    file.  If a file  is not available to  LIST because it is  locked by
    another process, you will receive the error message "File not found"
    or "Access denied".  There is  no command to enable or  disable this
    method of file sharing.  It is implicit with the use of DOS  version
    3 and later.



Invoking DOS Commands

    If the "goto DOS" option is enabled, you may invoke DOS commands  by
    using the Alt-G command.  LIST reserves about 60k of memory for  its
    own use.  This increases LIST's memory requirements to approximately
    96k when using Alt-G.  The remaining memory is available to the  DOS
    commands.


    After you  have finished  entering DOS  commands, use  the DOS  EXIT
    command to return to LIST.

    To disable the "goto DOS" function, you must use DEBUG to alter  the
    option  byte  described  in  the  section  about  cloning.   With it
    disabled, LIST requires less memory, about 66K.



Screen Saving

    If the screen saving option  is enabled, LIST saves the  contents of
    the current  display screen  when it  starts.  You  can restore  the
    original screen by exiting LIST with the Alt-X command.

    Screen  saving  requires  approximately  10k  more  memory.  This is
    sufficient to save  60 lines of  80 characters (EGA  8x6 mode).  See
    the section about Configuring LIST and cloning for information about
    enabling and disabling the screen saving feature.

    Each of these commands may be executed from within LIST PLUS and are
    described below.


Movement Keys

    Use the arrow keys to move  the cursor to a filename.  The  filename
    at  the  cursor  is  highlighted.   The  other  cursor  and filename
    selection keys are:

                PgDn            - displays the next page of files
                PgUp            - displays the previous page of files

                HOME            - positions to the first filename
                                  on the screen
                END             - positions to the last filename
                                  on the screen

                Ctrl-HOME       - positions to the first filename
                Ctrl-END        - positions to the last filename

                F1              - displays a Help screen
                ESCape          - exits to DOS

LIST PLUS Display


Changing Directories

    Any subdirectories contained  in the current  directory will have  a
    down arrow  next to  them.  If  you highlight  one of  these and hit
    Enter you will go to that directory.  If the directory that you  are
    in  is  a  subdirectory  itself,  there  will  be an up arrow .. and
    selecting this will take you  up.  Thus, you can easily  move around
    your hard disk from within LIST!


List file

    This invokes LIST just as  you would from DOS. Simply  highlight the
    file that you wish to view, enter a carriage return, and you will be
    in LIST looking  at the selected  file.  When you  are finished, you
    may escape back to the original screen, with all of its options.

    You may also open  a window and then,  using the Alt-V command,  get
    another  file  directory  and  select  another  file to view.  Using
    Alt-W, you can load more than two files.


Copy file

    This  function  allows  you  to  copy  the  selected  file  to a new
    subdirectory.  Highlight the file you want to copy and press  ENTER.
    You will be  prompted  for the  new  path to  which you want to copy
    the selected file.  Enter  the path,  press ENTER,  and the  file is
    copied to the directory you indicated.


Delete file

    Allows  you  to  delete  any  file  in  the current directory.  Just
    highlight the  file you  want to  delete and  press ENTER.  You will
    then be prompted  to make sure  that you want  to delete this  file.
    Enter Y if you do, and N if you do not.


Move file

    Move  any  file  in  the  current  directory to any other directory.
    Select the file that you want to move by highlighting it and hitting
    ENTER.  You will then  be prompted for a  new path.  Enter the  path
    and the file is moved to it's new location.


Path changing

    This function allows  you to switch  to ANY other  directory on your
    system without having to exit LIST!  Enter 'P' for Path, and type in
    the full path of the directory that you would like to change to, for
    example: C:\DNLD.  You will find yourself in the selected  directory
    and still within LIST.

Rename

    Using  this  function  you  can  rename  any  file  in  the  current
    directory.  Highlight the  file that you  want to rename.   You will
    then be prompted for  the new file name.   After you have entered  a
    new file name,  you will be  prompted to make  sure that you  really
    want to rename this file.  If so, then respond with a 'Y'; if you've
    changed  your  mind,  just  answer  with  an  'N'  and  the renaming
    procedure will be abandoned.


Sort filenames

    Allows you to sort the files in the current directory by file  name,
    extension, date, or size.  Once you have completed the operation you
    will find yourself back at the menu screen of LIST.


1-6 up display

    This function lets you set the display to anywhere from 1 to 6  file
    names per line.   In subdirectories with  few numbers of  files, you
    will begin to see not only file name, but file size, date, and  time
    as well.  You can customize this so that it suits your tastes.


ViewArc

    This function will let you  view the directory of an  archive (.ARC,
    .ZIP, etc.) file, or self-extracting .COM and .EXE archive files.

    After you have viewed the desired file's directory, press ESCape  to
    return to the  file selection menu,  or use the  Alt-I (insert file)
    command to display a file within the archive file.




            To view  archive directories,  the program  FV.COM is
            required.  It must be located in a directory included
            in your PATH.


            To display files within an ARChive file, the  program
            ARCE.COM is required.  It must be in your PATH.   For
            ZIP files, the program PKUNZIP  must  be in your PATH.

Screen Colors


    The screen's lines may be in one of three different colors:

                o  the 'special' color for the top status line and the
                   bottom command line
                o  the 'normal' color for the file's text windows
                o  the 'bright' color for lines with Find/Scan text,
                   and for the upside-down question mark in 7-bit mode

    There is a pair  of function keys assigned  to each color.  You  use
    these  function  keys  at  any  time  to  change  the background and
    foreground colors temporarily, or  use the Alt-C cloning  command to
    make the colors permanent.  Alt-C requires that the LIST.COM program
    file be on the current drive and in the current directory unless you
    are using DOS version 3.3 or later.  With DOS 3.3, the program  file
    may have any name and may reside in any subdirectory.

    The border  is not  changed.  The  foreground color  applies to  the
    color of the characters.

    You may clone a  second set of text  colors for the second,  and any
    other windows that you may create.

    The color attributes may be changed by using these function keys:

          For the main body of text:

                F5 - background color
                F6 - foreground color

          For the top and bottom lines:

                F7 - background color
                F8 - foreground color

          For the line with Find/Scan text:

                F2 - background color
                F4 - foreground

    Once you have decided upon the colors, use the Alt-C key combination
    to  change  the  LIST.COM  program  file.  This process is described
    below.

Cloning


    The screen colors, the display retrace testing (M), the file sharing
    (S), ruler (Alt-R), and other options may be permanently set in  the
    program COM file by using the Alt-C cloning function.

    For cloning to  take effect, the  program should be  called LIST.COM
    and on the current drive and in the current directory.

    There  are  THREE  versions  of  the  LIST program file.  One is the
    normal full program, which is LIST.COM.  The other, which is  called
    LISTS.COM, is a slightly smaller file that excludes the Help screen.
    The third is LIST PLUS, found as LISTP.COM.  You may use any of  the
    three  COM  files  for  cloning.   After  cloning,  you may continue
    viewing  the  file.   Several  of  the  command  toggles  are   also
    'clonable'.

    The values and toggles that are cloned are:

             M      =  Mono monitor, affects retrace testing. If you see
                       "snow" on your color monitor, turn off this option

             Alt-S  =  file(s) are shared

             W      =  Wrap long lines

             8/7/*  =  display all 256 values, or 7-bit, or special case

             K      =  flush Keyboard each time a command is read

             Alt-H  =  hex dump display, like the DEBUG format

             Alt-J  =  toggle "junk" filter, add LF to CR, fix backspaces

             Alt-L  =  set on to force preloading (reading) of the entire
                       file before any lines are displayed, Default is OFF.

             Alt-N  =  toggles screen saving (see Alt-X) feature

             Alt-R  =  toggle columnar ruler on top line

             Alt-T  =  toggle expansion of TAB characters

             Alt-V  =  number of filenames per line (up value) and sort method

             F2     =  change background color for Find/Scan text
             F4     =  change foreground color for Find/Scan text

             F5     =  change background color for main body of display
             F6     =  change foreground color for main body of display

             F7     =  change background color for top and bottom lines
             F8     =  change foreground color for top and bottom lines

    Note:  Be  sure  you  have  no  other  copies  of LIST.COM which are
    accessible (because  of a  filepath type  of utility).   If you  are
    familiar with the DOS utility DEBUG, you may want to modify LIST  in
    that way.  This is described in the next section.

  Locations of option values

    This information is offered to those of you who wish to modify  LIST
    in special ways.  You do not need this information to use LIST.   An
    alternative to cloning  is to use  DEBUG to make  permanent changes.
    Here is a list of key items and their addresses:

           0132 - special lines 1 and 25 colors, default is 70 (reverse).
                  Refer to a technical reference guide for the
                  attribute values for the colors that you want.

           0134 - normal lines 2 thru 24 colors, default is 07 (white)

           0136 - bright color for Find/Scan, default is 0F (bright white)

           0138 - color used for text for first window, default is 07 (white)
           0139 - color used for second window, default is 0F (bright white)

           013A - clonable options;
               MRSJ WHK*  M = mono, retrace testing if off, x'01'
                          R = ruler, x'02'
                          S = shared, x'04'
                          J = add LF to lone CR, process backspaces,
                              if on, x'08'; default is off
                          W = wrap mode, x'10'
                          H = hi-bit on, x'20'
                          K = kybd flush, x'40'
                          * = special document filtering, x'80'

           013B - more clonable options, not all are indicated:
               .PAT DGV.  P = Preload file if on, x'02', default is off
                          A = Apxcore if on, TV/DD/DV if off, x'04,
                              default is for Topview/Double DOS use
                          T = if on (default), expand TABs, x'08'
                          D = hex display mode if on, x'10'
                          G = if on, Alt-G goto DOS is Disabled, x'20'
                          V = if on, screen save/restore is Disabled
                              and 9K less memory is used/required, x'40'

    By specifying the bit value, the option is enabled.  For example, to
    enable Shared and Retrace, specify a hex value of the sum, or  01+04
    = 05.

           013C - row less one at which found text is displayed,  1 byte
                  the default is 08 which displays found text on line  9

    When the  Find/Scan command  is used,  the next  line which contains
    that text is highlighted using the 'bright' color, and is placed  in
    row 9 of the screen.  You can change the row by Altering the byte at
    location 12F which is normally '08', one less than the row.

           013E - scroll offset value,  default is 10 (x'0A'),  one byte

           0140 - scroll starting value, default is 0 (x'00'), one byte

  Reassigning keys

    LIST performs a function for every character that can be entered  at
    the command line prompt.  There  are 128 regular characters and  131
    extended characters.  The regular characters are numbered from 0  to
    127, and  they include  the letters  A-Z, a-z,  the numbers, and the
    rest of  the usual  single characters  found on  your keyboard.  The
    extended characters represent special function keys and combinations
    of keys, such as F1, Alt-X, Ctrl-A, and the cursor positioning keys.

    The  WHAT  table  in  LIST  has  a  one  byte  entry for each of the
    characters.  This byte is a number from 0 to 57 that represents  the
    identification of a routine that performs a function.

        For example,

          - the ESCape key has a value  of 27 (hex 1B) and its value  in
            the WHAT table is 16 (10 hex).  Routine number 16 is  called
            "Done".  The "Done" routine exits to DOS.

          - the Q key has a value of 81 (51 hex) with a routine value of
            15  for  the  "Close"  routine.   The  "Close"  routine ends
            viewing of the  current file and  tries to display  the next
            file, i.e. wildcards used for the filename.  There is also a
            lower case letter q, so be sure to change both entries.


    To change the function that a command character performs, you change
    the  value  in  the  WHAT  table  for the routine that the character
    invokes.

    For example, to  change the ESCape  key to act  like the Q  key, you
    change the routine  value for ESCape  from 16 (10  hex) to a  15 (0F
    hex).

    To find the location of the  routine value in the WHAT table,  first
    determine the value of the  character, e.g.  ESCape is 27  (1B hex),
    and then add that to the  location of the WHAT table (36C  hex); or,
    1B + 36C = 387 hex.  Finally,  use DEBUG to change the byte at  that
    location (387 hex) from a 10 hex to a 0F hex.

    For example,

          debug list.com                ; use appropriate file name
          -e 387 0f                     ; change ESC to routine 15
          -w                            ; old data is 10
          -q
