                               LICENSING FOR LIST
                               Effective 10/28/89

    Copies of LIST for personal use  are free.  If you find LIST  of value,
    you are encouraged  to make a  gift ($20 suggested)  and become a  LIST
    supporter.  Technical support is  available to LIST supporters  through
    the VOR bulletin board system at (707) 778-8944 at no charge. A license
    is required for use of LIST by corporations  and institutions,  and for
    its commercial distribution.

    This information also  applies to my  SORTF, QDR, FBR  programs, and to
    any of my other programs that may be of interest to you.

    You may obtain  a license for  the use of  LIST by writing  to me.  The
    license is for perpetual,  non-exclusive use of the  version.  Purchase
    orders  and  invoicing  are  acceptable.   A  license agreement form is
    enclosed.  You may use it, or supply your own for my review.

    If you have  special requirements, such  as licensing for  an unlimited
    number of copies, or customization, please feel free to submit them  in
    writing.  You may request a license for:

          o  a fixed number of copies, see the discount schedule;
          o  an unlimited number of copies;
          o  customization of messages and documentation,  an additional
             fee may be required depending on the extent of changes;
          o  permission  to  include  with  your  company's   commercial
             products; see the  commercial  distribution schedule;
          o  or other needs.

    The fee for a license depends on the estimated number of copies of  the
    program that you  will use.  The  fee applies to  one site.  For  local
    area networks, one copy must be licensed for each computer that will be
    using the program on the network.  To use the discount schedule  below,
    estimate the total number of copies that you may eventually use.

    Thank you for the interest you have shown in distributing my  programs.
    While I distribute my software  freely to individuals, I do  not adhere
    to the concept of distribution on a commercial basis, such as you  have
    proposed, since the  programs will be  sold, rather than  given freely.
    However, since this practice is becoming more prevalent, I have decided
    to make my programs available according to the commercial  distribution
    license fee schedule below.

                      Licensing is available for:

               o  Archiving Utilities ............. ARCE
               o  File Backup and Restore ......... FBR
               o  JET's Little Helper ............. JLH
               o  File viewing utility ............ LIST
               o  Laserjet Booklet Printer ........ LJBOOK
               o  Quick Basic Cross Referencer .... QBX
               o  File Sort Utility ............... SORTF
               o  Quick Diskette Reformatter ...... QDR

- Commercial distribution license fee is $100 per program plus the per-copy
  cost shown in the schedule below.
- Buerg Software will supply one disk and one manual under this licensing
  agreement.  Additional manuals are available at a cost of $5 per manual.
- Fee schedules shown are for the programs with and without the solicitation
  included.
  * If licensed without the solicitation, changes will be made to include
    "LICENSED TO your company name".
  * If licensed with the solicitation, no changes may be made to the
    program, other than those agreed to by Buerg Software at the time of
    licensing.

                                                    COST PER COPY
