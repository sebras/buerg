LIST Version 7.5f               WHAT'S NEW                             10/26/90

                        New Operational Features
                        ------------------------

      - the distribution files are LISTS.COM (small), LISTR.COM (regular), and
        LIST.COM (plus)

      - The new LIST environment variable tells LIST where to place temporary
        files for the ViewArc and archive extraction functions, e.g.

                SET LIST=C:\TEMP

      - A new /E command line switch tells LIST to begin displaying the files
        at the end of each file instead of at the beginning.

|     - A new /Ttext command line parameter searches all files immediately
|       for the 'text' and is case sensitive.  The /Ftext or /Ttext parameter
|       must be the last on the command line.  Both cannot be used at one time.

|     - A new /B command line switch tells LIST to use BIOS for displaying data

      - A new /K command line switch disables the mouse.  Both the /M and /K
        mouse options are clonable.

      - A new /#nnnnnn command line switch instructs LIST to begin displaying
        the file starting at line number 'nnnnnn'.

      - The /Ftext command line parameter to begin a text search through all
        selected files now invokes the Find function which is NOT case
        sensitive.

      - The maximum "logical" record size has been increased from 910 to 2048.

      - A second Help screen is now available in the Plus version which shows
        all of the Ctrl- and cursor key functions

      - A great improvement in speed is available when all filter options are
        set off.  Use alt-Z to display the toggles on the bottom line.  An
        option is off when its corresponding letter, e.g.  'J' for alt-J junk
        filter or 'T' for the alt-T tab expansion filter, is in lower case.

      - The Viewarc function now assumes that .EXE and .COM files are LHARC
        files.  Otherwise, if a file does not have the .ARC, .LZH, or .ZIP
        extension, the file is assumed to be a .ARC file.


                              File Selection Menu
                              -------------------

      - New commands are available from the File Selection (Alt-V) menu:

              E    invokes the 'Edit' editor to let you edit the selected file;
                   create a BATch file called EDIT.BAT which invokes the
                   editor of your choice with the optional parameters it needs

              I    invokes (executes) the selected program

          Alt-Z    toggles the status display on the bottom line from disk and
                   file statistics line to a menu command help line
LIST Version 7.5f                 WHAT'S NEW                           10/26/90


      - Changes to other file selection menu (Alt-V) commands:

         -  Q)uit returns you to the display of the last file you viewed
            if no file has been displayed, Q exits to DOS.

         -  X and F10 exit to DOS in the NEW directory

         -  ESCape exits to DOS in the ORIGINAL directory

         -  Alt-X exits to DOS and shows the original screen

         -  the 1-up display now includes the file attributes

         -  Alt-C saves (clones) the settings

         -  the S)ort command now has a None (no sort) ordering option


                                 New Commands
                                 ------------

      - A new ctrl-Y command saves the current position as a bookmark, and
        alt-Y repositions to the last bookmark. You may set up to ten bookmarks
        and recall them in the same order.

      - A new 1 command restarts displaying files with the first file.

      - A new Ctrl-right command scrolls the screen right to the end of the
        current line.

|     - A new O command toggles the date format from U.S. mm/dd/yy to
|       European format dd-mm-yy.


                                Changed Commands
                                ----------------

      - The X command exits to DOS and clears the screen. In the Plus version,
        you are now placed in the new (selected) directory.

      - The Alt-G command (shell to DOS) now clears the screen.

      - The Alt-R Ruler option has been improved to better show offsets
        when in the Hex Dump (Alt-H) display mode.

      - The Alt-D and Alt-O (write lines to a file) commands have been changed
        to default to writing a found (highlighted line after Scan or Find)
        line if no lines have been marked.

      - The ctrl-I command has been added to the Plus version.  It allows
        setting the TAB interval to values other than the standard 8.  Ctrl-I
        prompts you to enter the new interval, which can be from 1 to 99.

                        03DD    0026    Key command table

        Examples of using DEBUG can be found in the DIALER.PAT and
        COLORS.PAT files. To use them, copy LIST.COM to the current
        directory and issue the DEBUG command. For example:

                DEBUG <DIALER.PAT
