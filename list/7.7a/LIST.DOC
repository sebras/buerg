Introduction 

 
    LIST is a user supported program.  It is not public domain.  You may 
    use LIST and  give it to your friends,  but you  may not  sell it or 
    use it in business without obtaining a license.  See the  last page 
    for information about licensing. 
 
 
    You use LIST to display files on your monitor, line by line with the 
    aid of scrolling, positioning and filtering commands. 
 
 
    LIST PLUS has many new  commands which go beyond usual  file viewing 
    and browsing.  We will  explain how LIST is  used, and then how  the 
    new file management commands are used. 
 
 
    Before going  into all  of the  ways in  which LIST  can be  used to 
    display files, let's look at  the three different varieties of  LIST 
    so that you understand the capabilities of each.  Then, we'll go  on 
    and define certain terms  like: redirection, piping, and  filtering. 
    In this way, you will better understand how you can use these things 
    with LIST.

Introduction 


Installation 
 
    There are three varieties of the  LIST program on the disk that  you 
    received (or in the file  that you downloaded).  This allows  you to 
    pick the version of LIST that is right for you, and to configure  it 
    to be exactly the way YOU want it to be. 
 
    Decide which of the LIST programs you would like to use and copy the 
    .COM file to your working disk, or into a subdirectory on your  hard 
    disk.  Selecting a directory that is in your PATH will allow you  to 
    use LIST from anywhere on your system. 
 
    You may  rename the  program file  to any  convenient name,  such as 
    L.COM,  READ.COM,  LST.COM  or  leave  it as LIST.COM.  For example, 
    place the distribution disk into drive A and enter the commands: 
 
            A: 
            COPY LIST.COM C:\L.COM 
 
    to copy  the Plus  version to  the root  directory of  your C drive, 
    renaming the program to L.COM in the process. 
 

Printing the manual 
 
    To print the documentation, set your printer for six lines per inch, 
    and 10 characters per inch.   Then, use the DOS PRINT  command.  For 
    example, 
 
                        PRINT LIST.DOC 
 
    You may also  print out the  documentation by using  redirection and 
    entering: 
 
                        TYPE LIST.DOC > LPT1 
 
    Better yet, use LIST to print the manual.  Enter 
 
                        LIST LIST.DOC 
 
    then press the Ctrl and P keys at the same time.

    There is also a commercial version of LIST called LIST Enhanced. 
    The main differences between LIST Plus and LIST Enhanced are: 
 
    - the File Selection menu has: 
       - file tagging, including tag all, untag, retag, etc. 
       - archive file extract and add/update commands 
       - a sweep command to execute a specified program with all of 
         the tagged files

       - change video modes 
       - a directory tree display command 
       - the rename command taht can rename directories 
       - a command to create new directories 
 
    - the viewer part has: 
       - the alt-E command presents a menu offering up to 6 video modes 
         including 132x25, 132x43, 80x43, etc, if the video adapter 
         supports that text mode

         to the end of file 
       - handling of files up to 32 mb in size, larger upon request 
       - the wrap option splits the line at a word boundary 
 
    - in general: 
       - allocates memory more efficiently: can run in as little as 100k 
         with all functions 
       - supports UltraVision video utility 
       - options to use regular DOS input routines that take advantage of 
         PCED, DOSKEY, or other keyboard utilities; or, to use an internal 
         input routine which allows command line editing 
       - a customization program that can be used to set any of the LIST 
         options or toggle, and save them to a file, or read the options 
         saved in a file; the customization program can define other 
         printer names, can define all the names of archive programs used, 
       - a 170-page spiral bound manual 
       - a 6-panel Quick Reference card of all commands 
       - one year of free updates 
       - telephone, FAX, and BBS support

DOS Redirection 
 
    The output of a  DOS command can be  "redirected" to a device  other 
    than  the  standard  output  device,  which  is  in  most cases, the 
    monitor.  This is done simply by entering the command, followed by a 
    ">" and then the name of the desired device.  For example. 
 
    If you type "DIR > FILE.LST" you will see nothing on your screen and 
    then suddenly your  DOS prompt will  reappear.  What happened?   The 
    "output" of the DIR command was "redirected" to the file, FILE.LST. 
 
    In the same manner, you  could enter the following command  and send 
    the contents of FILE.LST to your printer, like so: "TYPE FILE.LST  > 
    LPT1" 
 
    The ">" symbol stands for  redirection of output to another  device. 
    Broken down simply, the following command is saying: 
 
                    DIR            >       FILE.LST 
          (send output of this)  (TO)   (This device, which is a file) 
 
    By the same token, you can also redirect "input" to a DOS command or 
    a program like SORT  by using the "<"  symbol.  Here is an  example: 
    "SORT  <  FILE.LST"  This  command  would  take  the  information in 
    FILE.LST  and  "redirect"  it  into  SORT.   For more information on 
    redirection, you  may want  to consult  a DOS  manual or  other such 
    reference.

Definition of DOS terms

DOS Filters 
 
    FILTERS are  commands, or  programs, that  read data  from an  input 
    device, and  then rearranges  or "filters"  the data  before it then 
    outputs the  filtered information  to an  output device.   DOS comes 
    with several "filters", one of which is SORT.  The following command 
    would sort the file in alphabetical order. 
 
                                SORT < FILE.LST 
 
    You are redirecting the file,  FILE.LST through the SORT filter  and 
    it is rearranging the file.  Taking what you know about  redirection 
    and  filters,  you  could  now  send  your  alphabetical list to yet 
    another  file  by  entering:  SORT  <  FILE.LIST  > ALPHA.LST, which 
    redirects FILE.LST into the SORT "filter" and then redirects the new 
    output  to  the  file  ALPHA.LST.   LIST  also has some very helpful 
    "filters" built  right into  it and  we'll discuss  these later  on. 
    Simply keep in mind that when  you use a "filter" it will  rearrange 
    or alter the  information into a  form that is  more presentable, or 
    useful, to you.

DOS Pipes 
 
    Pipes are  quite similar,  in some  ways, to  redirection.  They are 
    "connections" between two programs or two commands or a command  and 
    a program.   Pipes take  data that  is output  from one  program and 
    redirect it as input to a second program.  The DOS symbol for a pipe 
    is the vertical bar "|".  To redirect the output from one program or 
    command to another, you simply type the first command followed by  a 
    vertical bar and  then followed by  the second command.   Here is an 
    example of piping. 
 
                                DIR | FIND "-88" 
 
    This command tells DOS to send the output of the DIR command,  which 
    you would normally see on the  screen, and send it through the  FIND 
    filter.  FIND  would be  searching each  line for  the string "-88". 
    Only the files in the current directory that have a 1988 date  stamp 
    would be displayed on the screen!  You can use more than one  "pipe" 
    in a command.  Take this final example: 
 
                       DIR | FIND "-88" | SORT/+14 > PRN 
 
    A "pipe" takes the  output of the DIR  command and converts it  into 
    input for the FIND  filter.  Then, a second  "pipe" is used to  send 
    the output from FIND as input  to the SORT filter.  As a  last step, 
    output from  SORT is  redirected to  the printer!   What would  this 
    command do??   It would  take the  DIR of  the current directory and 
    pipe it through the FIND filter, looking for files created in  1988. 
    Then the next pipe would SORT that information, sorting the files by 
    SIZE (the 14th column of each line) and then send the output to  the 
    printer.  For  more information  on PIPES,  consult a  DOS manual or 
    other reference. 
 
    Now that you have  a basic understanding of  redirection, filtering, 
    and piping, we will go on to discuss the command line of LIST.

______________________________________________________________________________

 

Command line syntax 
 
    The command line format is: 
 
 
        LIST [filespec...filespec] [/switches] 
 
 
    You may supply  one or more  file specifications (filespecs).   LIST 
    will display  each file  which has  a filename  matching one  of the 
    filespecs.  If you  do not supply  one, LIST will  prompt you for  a 
    filespec, or present you with a file selection menu. 
 
 

Command line switches 
        /?      displays LIST usage information 
 
        /B      tells LIST to use the BIOS for displaying data 
                instead of using direct screen writes 
 
        /D      forces display of the File Selection menu for the 
                specified files, e.g. *.TXT for a menu display of 
                only files with an extension of TXT 
 
        /E      tells LIST to begin displaying the files from the 
                end of each file instead of from the beginning 
 
        /K      disables the mouse; both /M and /K mouse options 
                are clonable 
 
        /Q      toggles sounding of beeps; the same as Alt-Q 
 
        /V      causes a verify operation to be performed after 
                any Copy or Move operation; the /V option defaults 
                to the value of the DOS VERIFY setting 
 
        /4      places LIST into 443 (or 50) line display mode; 
                this requires an EGA or BGA display adaptor 
 
        /S      indicates viewing a piped or redirected file 
 
        /J      sets Junk filter on 
        /7      sets 7-bit display 
        /8      sets 8-bit display 
        /*      sets star filter on

Command line 
______________________________________________________________________________

        /W      sets Wrap on 
        /H      sets Hex dump mode 
        /L      sets pre-Loading on 
 
        /M      allows use of a mouse for moving the cursor 
        /K      disables mouse for cursor positioning 
 
        /Ftext  begins a text search through all of the selected files 
                and is case insensitive 
 
        /Ttext  searches all files immediately for the 'text' and is 
                case sensitive; the /Ftext and /Ttext options MUST be 
                the last options on the command line; both cannot be 
                used at one time 
 
        /#nnnn  begins displaying the file at record 'nnnnnn' 
 
    The command line switch character is normally a slash, "/", but LIST 
    will use whatever  character that is  defined to DOS  as the command 
    line switch character, e.g. a  dash, "-".  Depending on your  needs, 
    you could load LIST using  any of these command line  switches, such 
    as: 
 
               LIST MYFILE.TXT /W   which would set Word Wrap ON. 
 
               LIST MYFILE.TXT /J   which turns on the JUNK filter 
 
    The L, W, M, S and /J command line switches may be used to disable 
    the corresponding option by adding a minus symbol to them. For 
    example,  /-W  or  /W-  will set wrap off.

How to use LIST 
______________________________________________________________________________

Starting LIST 

    To  start  LIST,  you  type  the  command  LIST,  at the DOS prompt, 
    followed by  the name(s)  of the  files that  you want  to see.  For 
    example: 
 
          C:>LIST CONFIG.SYS        (displays file CONFIG.SYS) 
 
          C:>LIST *.DOC    (displays all DOC files in current directory) 
 
    The "filename" is optional.  If  omitted, LIST PLUS will bring  up a 
    display of ALL  files and subdirectories  in the current  directory. 
    You may use  the cursor keys  to highlight the  file that you  would 
    like to work  on and press  ENTER.  Or, you  may highlight any  sub- 
    directory entry and press ENTER to change to that subdirectory. 
 
    You  may  also  use  LIST  to  display piped or redirected files.  A 
    discussion of redirection, piping, and filtering is at the beginning 
    of this manual. 
 
    To display a redirected file, use a < (less than symbol) before  the 
    name of the file that was redirected and add the /S parameter to the 
    LIST command. 
 
    For example, the output of the DIR command can be written to a  file 
    called XYZ, and then LIST can be instructed to read that file. 
 
                dir a: >xyz 
                list <xyz /s 
 
    To see a piped file, omit the filename, but supply the /S. 
 
                dir a: | list /s 
 
    Or, to LIST a file within an ARC archive: 
 
                ARC /p arcname.arc filename.ext | list /s 
                                - or - 
                ARCE arcname filename.ext /p | list /S 
 
    Here,  the  ARC   or  ARCE  program   is  invoked  to   extract  the 
    'filename.ext' file.   The /P  switch for  these programs  sends the 
    output to the  standard output device,  and this output  is piped to 
    LIST.  Once the  file is  displayed on your screen,  you may use the 
    cursor positioning  keys to  move around  and see different parts of 
    the file.  There are  also commands to search for text, print, split 
    the screen, display  other  files,  change  colors,  change  the way 
    the data is displayed, and many other operations.

How to use LIST 
______________________________________________________________________________

Exiting LIST 

 
    There are several ways  to exit LIST depending  on how you want  the 
    screen to look. 
 
    The F10 command returns you to DOS with the DOS prompt on the bottom 
    line.  The  last page  that was  displayed by  LIST is  left on  the 
    screen. 
 
    The ESCape key also returns you to DOS without changing the  screen. 
    In LIST PLUS, the ESCape key is also used to cancel an operation, or 
    to exit file selection menu. 
 
    The X command  returns you to  DOS and clears  the screen.  The  DOS 
    prompt is on the top line of the screen. 
 
    The Alt-X command uses the screen saving feature.  It returns you to 
    DOS and displays the screen that you had before LIST was run. 
 

  Entering Commands 
 
    You enter  commands by  pressing a  single key,  or a combination of 
    keys.  There  are often  several ways  to perform  the same function 
    with different keys.  For example, D and PgDn both perform a  scroll 
    down one page function.   This lets you pick  the keys that you  are 
    most accustomed to. 
 
    When  you  press  keys,  they  are  entered  into a keyboard buffer. 
    Holding down a key can put many copies of that key into the  buffer. 
    This means that when you let up  on a key, the program can still  be 
    processing input from the keyboard buffer.  For example, by  holding 
    down the PgDn key, LIST scrolls down one page for each time the PgDn 
    key is placed in the keyboard  buffer.  When you let up on  the key, 
    the buffer may not yet be empty and LIST will continue to page down. 
    To make  LIST stop  when you  let up  on a  key, you  use the  Alt-K 
    key-ahead toggle. 
 
    Keyboard enhancement utilities,  such as PCED,  may also change  the 
    way that LIST reads the keyboard.  With PCED, for example,  pressing 
    the ESCape key at a prompt is different.  You do not see the /  that 
    DOS normally sends when you cancel an input line.

Display Format 

    The monitor  display is  defined in  terms of  lines and columns.  A 
    typical  monitor  can  display  25  lines  of 80 columns each.  LIST 
    attempts to use the number of lines and columns for the monitor mode 
    in use.  For  example, if the  monitor is in  132 column mode,  LIST 
    displays 132 characters per line.   If the monitor is set  for other 
    than 25 lines, such as 35, 43, or 50 lines, LIST displays that  many 
    lines per screen. 
 
    If  you  use  the  Alt-E  command  to  change EGA/VGA modes, the EGA 
    palette,  cursor,  and  other  settings  are  set to the DOS default 
    values.  LIST does not preserve fonts or palettes. 
 
    The top line of the display  is called the Status line.  The  bottom 
    line is called the Command line.  The remaining lines are called the 
    primary display window, and are usually lines two through 24. 

  Status Line Format 
 
    The Status line has two formats. The default format is:

        'lllllll'  is the line number of the first line in the primary 
                   display window (under the status line) 
 
        'nnnnnnn'  is the line number of the last record of the file; 
                   if the last record of the file has not been read, 
                   this field shows the percentage of the file that 
                   has been read 
 
        '+sss'     if displayed, this is the Scroll amount, in multiples 
                   of 10, corresponding to the number of columns that 
                   the display has been shifted to the right to view 
                   records longer than 80

Scrolling 

 
    You view different parts of the file by scrolling.  That is, you use 
    the cursor  positioning keys  up, down,  left and  right to move the 
    display one  increment in  that direction.   For example,  press the 
    down  arrow  key  to  move  the  display  one line in the file, i.e. 
    display the next line in the file. 
 
 
    The PgDn and PgUp  cursor keys move the  display one full screen  in 
    either direction. 
 
 
    Rather than press the up and  down keys once for each line,  you may 
    use  continuous  scrolling.   Use  the  C  key  to toggle continuous 
    scrolling on or off.  The default is off.  When toggled on, pressing 
    the up or down arrow keys results in a moving display.  For example, 
    when  you  press  the  down  arrow,  the  next  line  of the file is 
    displayed automatically  every second,  or so.   It is  like holding 
    down the arrow key.  To stop the continuous scroll, press the  space 
    bar. 
 
 
    The speed of the continuous scroll can be adjusted by pressing the + 
    (plus) or - (minus) key while  the display is moving.  The plus  key 
    makes  the  display  move  faster,  and  the minus key makes it move 
    slower.  You can save the  speed value by using the  cloning command 
    (see Configuring LIST, Cloning, later on in this documentation.  The 
    speed is  independent of the computer speed and can be adjusted from 
    approximately 50 lines per minute to 1000 lines per minute.

Positioning to Lines 

 
    Each displayable line  of the file  is assigned a  line number.  The 
    first line is  assigned line number  1.  The highest  allowable line 
    number is 16 million. 
 
    In order to  determine the last  line number of  a file, the  entire 
    file must be  read.  For this  reason, the first  time that the  END 
    (bottom) command is issued, it will take longer to process.  This is 
    not necessary if  the file has  been completely read  (see the Alt-L 
    preloading option). 
 
    If the Wrap option is in  effect, there is one line number  required 
    for each 80 bytes of the file's records.  Thus, the line number does 
    not represent the actual number of lines in the file. 
 
    If  the  hex  dump  option  is  in  effect, there is one line number 
    required for  each 16  bytes of  the file.   For example, an 80-byte 
    line will be displayed as 5 lines. 
 
    You may position to a  specific line number by using  the Ctrl-Home, 
    or the # key.  When Ctrl-Home  is entered, you are prompted for  the 
    line number.   Enter the  line number.   The display  will now begin 
    with that line number at the top of the screen. 
 
    To position  forward or  backward, you  may use  the +  (plus), or - 
    (minus) keys.  You are prompted to  enter the number of lines to  be 
    skipped.  The display  resumes at the  line number shown  on the top 
    (status) line, plus or minus the number of lines that you specified. 
 
    When you change  a filter option,  such as Wrap,  the line numbering 
    changes.  An attempt is made  to retain the same file  position, but 
    the file may be repositioned at the top. 
 
    You may also reposition to the last "active" line by using the Alt-Y 
    bookmark command.   The last  active line  is one  displayed after a 
    Scan or Find command, or marked using the  Alt-M or  Alt-B commands, 
    or the line set by the Ctrl-Y bookmark command.  Up to ten book mark 
    lines may be saved by Ctrl-Y and recalled by Alt-Y

Filtering 

 
    Filtering is the term used to describe the process that LIST uses to 
    format file data  for displaying on  a monitor.  After  data is read 
    from a file, it is  filtered.  The method of filtering  depends upon 
    the options in effect.   LIST is fastest with no filter options set. 
 
    For a typical  ASCII text file,  the filter removes  carriage return 
    and line feed characters, and expands TAB characters. 
 
    Because files  contain different  kinds of  data, there  are several 
    commands to  tell LIST  how to  display the  data.  The process that 
    LIST uses to make the  file data readable is called  filtering.  The 
    filters in LIST can: 
 
            o  replace non-text and control characters with blanks 
            o  expand TAB characters 
            o  display line drawing characters 
            o  change 8-bit (W*) data to readable 7-bit text ** 
            o  display the hexadecimal values for each character 
            o  remove "junk", such as control codes and backspaces 
 
           **  W* is an abbreviation for WordStar (tm) formatted files 
               which contain 'high-bit' characters. Using the '*' filter 
               makes these files easier to read. 
 
    LIST was designed primarily to display ASCII files;  that is,  files 
    which  contain  text,  and  not  binary  or  control  codes.    Text 
    characters, like A-Z and 0-9,  are in the 7-bit range.  Binary files 
    like .COM and .EXE files, contain the full range of 8-bit characters 
    and the  Alt-H (hex dump display)  command is available  for viewing

    Characters  above  127  (the  8-bit  range)  may  be  valid  graphic 
    characters, and may  be displayed if  the '8' command  is in effect. 
    To insure that characters above  ASCII value 127 are NOT  displayed, 
    use the '7' command to limit the display to characters in the  7-bit 
    range.

Filtering 


  Wrap Filter 
 
    The file is displayed with one logical record on each display  line: 
    usually 80 characters.  A logical record ends in a linefeed and  may 
    be up to 2048 characters long.   If a record  exceeds 80 characters, 
    you may view the portion beyond  the 80 columns by using the  scroll 
    right command, or by using  the Wrap feature.  The Wrap  (W) command 
    toggles ON or OFF the  wrapping of lines longer than  80 characters. 
    With Wrap on, lines are  displayed in their entirety, 80  characters 
    per  display  line.   The  scroll  left  (arrow)  and  right (arrow) 
    functions are disabled when Wrap is ON. 
 

  Hi-bit Filter 
 
    The 7,  8, and  * (asterisk)  commands determine  whether characters 
    above  ASCII-127  are  displayed.   If  the  hi-bit option is off (7 
    command), the filter strips the high order bit from each  character. 
    If the hi-bit  option is on  (8 command), all  characters, including 
    graphic characters above ASCII-127, are displayed. 
 

  Star Filter 
 
    The  star  (*  or  asterisk)  command displays only ASCII characters 
    below 128 (x'80'), but treats the special characters x'8A' and x'8D' 
    as  line-feed  and  carriage-return  control  characters.  Any other 
    characters above 127 are treated as spaces, and control codes  below 
    ASCII-26 are replaced by blanks. 
 

  Junk Filter 
 
    The  Alt-J  command  toggles  the  "junk"  filter which insures that 
    carriage  returns  in  the  file  also  result in a new line.  Also, 
    backspace  characters  result  in  "backing  up"  the display by one 
    position.   This   allows  more   readability  of   files  that  use 
    backspacing to emphasize, or over-write, characters.

Filtering 


  Hex Format Filter 
 
    The hex  dump option  (Alt-H) causes  the filtering  to reformat the 
    file data into a DEBUG-like  display format.  The largest file  that 
    can be displayed in Hex is 4 million bytes. 
 
    An attempt is made to  retain the file position when  switching from 
    normal to  hex-dump display,  but due  to filtering  changing record 
    lengths, the hex display may begin before the current record. 

  Tab expansion filter 
 
    The tab expansion option (Alt-T) cause LIST to insert spaces into a 
    a line.  The default tab expansion interval is eight spaces resulting 
    in placing non-blank data in columns 1, 9, 17, 25, etc.  The Ctrl-I 
    command can be used to change the tab interval from 1 to 99. 
 
    Summary of filtering commands: 
 
        8       show all characters as-is 
        7       strip the hi-bit from each character 
        *       use the star filter to remove control characters 
                and some special word processor characters 
 
        Alt-J   use the "junk" filter 
        Alt-H   use the "hex" filter to display in hex dump format

Scanning for text 

 
    There are three ways  to initiate a search  for text.  First is  the 
    Find (\ or F) command.  Use this command to search for text  without 
    regard to the case (upper or  lower) of the letters.  Second is  the 
    Scan (/ or S) command.  Use  this command to search an exact  match. 
    That is, the search is case-sensitive. 
 
    The third way to initiate a  search for text is with the  /F command 
    line switch.  With it, you supply  the text to search for, and  LIST 
    begins the search before displaying the file, and before asking  for 
    commands.  The search continues  through all selected files  until a 
    match is found, or the last file has been searched.  This search  is 
    case-insensitive. 
 
    Each search begins at  the line displayed on  the top of the  screen 
    and proceeds in a forward direction until the end of file.  You  may 
    start a search that goes backwards rather than forwards by using the 
    ` (left quote) key instead of Find (\), or by using ' (right  quote) 
    instead of Scan (/). 
 
    To enter the Scan search text, type a slash (/) followed by up to 31 
    characters.  The Scan  text is displayed  on the command  line.  The 
    Scan is  case-sensitive.   That is,  lower case  Scan text will only 
    match lower case file text. 
 
    While the program is searching for the text, the bottom display line 
    is changed to say "Looking".   Pressing ANY key while the  search is 
    in progress will terminate the search and display the message  'Text 
    not found' on the bottom line. 
 
    If the  text is  found, the  line containing  it is  displayed as  a 
    high-intensity line (bright color) in  the middle of the screen. The 
    search text is displayed in reverse video colors on the  highlighted 
    line.  The line where the  found text  is displayed  depends on  the 
    setting of the "Find Row" (see Configuration section). 
 
    The display is scrolled left or right, as needed, so that the  found 
    text is visible. 
 
    If the text is  NOT found, the command  line is changed to  say '*** 
    Text not found ***', and the rest of the display remains unchanged. 
 
    To  find  the  next  occurrence  of  the  same  text, use the A)gain 
    command, or press the  F3 key.  If you  wish to continue the  search 
    through all of the remaining files, use the Alt-A command.  To  find 
    the previous occurrence, press the F9 key.

Scanning for text 

    If the a keyboard enhancement  program, such as PCED, is  installed, 
    the up/down cursor  keys may be  used to recall  and edit previously 
    entered Scan/Find text. 
 
    In  a  shared  file  environment,  if  the  file changes while being 
    listed, the file position may become invalid.  Use the HOME  command 
    to  insure  proper  file  synchronization,  or  use the Alt-S (share 
    files) command again. 
 
 
 
    Summary of scanning commands:

______________________________________________________________________________

Marking and Extracting Lines 

 
    There are two ways that lines can be extracted from a file: 
 
 
              o  with the P (print) and Alt-P (print marked) commands, 
              o  with the Alt-D (dump data) and Alt-O commands. 
 
 
    The  lines  to  be  extracted  are  either  the current lines on the 
    screen,  or  lines  that  you  have  marked with the Alt-M and Alt-B 
    commands,  or  a line found by the Find or Scan commands. 
 
 
    To mark  lines, you  use either  the Alt-M  or Alt-B  commands.  The 
    Alt-M command marks the top line on the screen, and Alt-B marks  the 
    bottom line on the screen.  You  can use either or both commands  to 
    mark the  starting and  ending lines  (in the  range of  lines to be 
    extracted).  The marked lines are displayed in reverse video. 
 
    After you have marked  a range of lines,  you use the Alt-P  (print) 
    command to print all of the marked lines.  Or, you can use the Alt-D 
    (dump  data)  command  to  write  those  lines to a file.  The Alt-D 
    command asks you for a file name.  If the file does not exist, a new 
    one is created.  If the file already exists, the extracted lines are 
    added (appended) to the file.  If no lines are marked, Alt-D  either 
    writes the current line (top line) or the highlighted line  that was 
    found by the Find or Scan commands. 
 
    For example, you would like to have LIST filter out all of the  junk 
    in a file, and then write a  new file.  To do this, you might  enter 
    the following sequence of commands: 
 
 
                list TESTDATA           ... display your TESTDATA file 
                Alt-J                   ... filters out the junk 
                Alt-M                   ... marks line 1 (top line) 
                END                     ... positions to end of file 
                Alt-B                   ... marks the bottom line 
                                                     (last line) 
                Alt-D                   ... dumps data to a file 
                TESTDATE.NEW            ... you enter the new file name 
                Alt-X                   ... quit and return to DOS 
 
 
    Once you have marked  a range of lines,  use of Alt-M or  Alt-B does 
    not reset the entire line range.  The first or last marked line  may 
    change,  but  both  do  not  change.   Using  Alt-M again expands or

Marking and Extracting Lines 

    contracts the range appropriately.  If the new line for  Alt-M/Alt-B 
    is before the top mark, the top  mark is moved.  If the new line  is 
    after the bottom mark, the bottom mark is changed.  If the new  line 
    is within  the currently  marked range,  Alt-M moves  the top mark - 
    contracts the range - and Alt-B moves the bottom mark. 
 
 
    If no lines are marked, but there is a "found" line on the screen as 
    the result of a search by Scan or Find, Alt-D  and Alt-O  will write 
    the found line to the file. 
 
 
    Use the Alt-U command to unmark lines, especially after Alt-D (dump) 
    to be sure.

Printing 

 
    The file may be PRINTed as it is displayed, in its entirety, or from 
    a range of lines that you  mark.  If the printer is not  online, you 
    will receive an error message, and nothing will be printed. 
 
 
    The P command  toggles the printer  on or off.   When first entered, 
    the P command causes the current screen to be printed.  As new lines 
    are displayed, they too are printed.  For example, pressing the down 
    arrow will display and print the next line of the file. 
 
 
    Printing may be  stopped by entering  another P command.   The PrtSc 
    key may also be used, but the title and prompt lines will be printed 
    with the lines of the file.  Empty lines cause a line to be  skipped 
    on the  printer.  The  capital letter  P is  displayed on the status 
    line while printing if the bottom line is set to show TOGGLES. 
 
 
    The Ctrl-P command prints the file in its entirety. 
 
 
    The Ctrl-F command  sends a form  feed to the  printer.  The printer 
    defaults to the LPT1 or PRN device. 
 
 
    The Alt-P command prints only lines that have been marked.

Displaying multiple files 

 
    You can display more than one  file at a time.  LIST keeps  track of 
    up to 32 files at a  time.  You supply the filenames in  the command 
    line,  through  the  Alt-F  (get  new filespec) command, through the 
    Alt-I  (insert  filespec)  command,  and  through  the  Alt-V   file 
    selection menu.  The  Alt-F  command is disabled whe viewing a piped 
    file. 
 
    You  can  specify  up  to  16  filespecs  on the command line.  Each 
    filespec can contain wildcards.  Thus, several files can be selected 
    via the command line.  For example, 
 
                          LIST *.DOC  *.TXT 
 
    will display all files with an extension of DOC and TXT. 
 
    To display the next file, you use the Q or Ctrl-PgDn command.   When 
    the last file has been displayed, you can exit LIST by using the  X, 
    F10, ESCape, or Alt-X commands, depending on how you want the screen 
    to look when LIST ends. 
 
    To display  the previous  file,  you use the Z or Ctrl-PgUp (control 
    and PgUp keys together).  The 1 command  restarts the  displaying of 
    files  with the first file.  LIST  can keep  track of up to 32 files 
    at one time.  The line number for each file is remembered. 
 
 
    The Alt-F asks you for a new  file name, and you may enter a  simple 
    file name, or  one that includes  wild cards.  These  new file names 
    are added to the table of filenames that LIST keeps.  Thus, you  can 
    use Alt-F for several different filenames, and use the Ctrl-PgDn and 
    Ctrl-PgUp commands to move among them. 
 
    The Alt-I command  allows you to  select a filespec  that is in  the 
    file you are  viewing.  You position  the cursor to  the filespec on 
    the  screen,  and  press  enter  to  add  it to the list of files to 
    display. 
 
    The Alt-V command displays a list of file in the current  directory. 
    You move the cursor  to a file that  you want to display,  and press 
    enter to add that file to the list.

Windows 

 
    LIST can  display data  in one  or two  parts of  the screen  called 
    windows.   The  Alt-W  command  toggles  this  split  screen   mode. 
    Entering Alt-W while the screen  is split restores the display  to a 
    single, full sized display. 
 
 
    In the regular version, the screen is split in the middle.  The  top 
    half of the screen remains the same, and the bottom half becomes the 
    part of the screen where files are displayed.  Thus, the top  window 
    becomes a scratch pad. 
 
 
    In the LIST PLUS version, you are allowed to split the screen at any 
    point.  After entering Alt-W, you  are asked to position the  cursor 
    to the spot where the screen  will be split.  By placing the  cursor 
    in column 1, you can adjust how  many lines will be used by the  top 
    and bottom windows.  This would  be a vertical, or one  window above 
    the other, split. 
 
    By positioning the cursor to the top line with the HOME key, you can 
    then use the left  and right arrow keys  to adjust how wide  each of 
    the windows is to be.   This would be a horizontal,  or side-by-side 
    split. 
 
    You may display  a different file  in each window,  and move between 
    them.  You use the Ctrl-V command  to switch from one window to  the 
    other.  You may also use the Review commands to display a  different 
    file in the second window.   The Ctrl-V command has no effect unless 
    you are  viewing two  or more  files, i.e. a different  file in each 
    window. 
 
    Each window uses different colors.   You can use the color  commands 
    to set the colors that you  like, and then use the Alt-C  command to 
    save them.

Telephone dialer 

 
    LIST has a simple telephone dialer function.  It allows you to point 
    to a telephone number that is  displayed on the screen, and to  send 
    dialing commands to your modem on COM1. 
 
 
    You use the  Ctrl-T command to  start the dialer.   You position the 
    cursor, with the arrow  keys, to the start  of the phone number  and 
    press enter.  The phone number  may contain any character, but  must 
    end with a blank.  If a  highlighted line is displayed on the screen 
    as a result of Find or Scan, the cursor is  initially placed  at the 
    found text. 
 
    If the phone rings, you may pick up your telephone.  Otherwise,  you 
    may press <enter> to return to viewing the file, <spacebar> to  dial 
    the number again, or ESCape to hang up and stop dialing. 
 
 
    The Ctrl-H command hangs up the telephone. 
 
 
    If you are using a communications  port other than  COM1:,  see  the 
    file DIALER.PAT for  information on  changing LIST  to use  COM2: or 
    another COM port.

DOS considerations 
______________________________________________________________________________


File Sharing 
 
    LIST uses two techniques for allowing you to share files with  other 
    processes, such as programs running under multi-tasking systems,  in 
    other windows, or on networks. 
 
    The first technique is called  "file closing" and is enabled  by the 
    Alt-S commands.  This forces LIST to close the viewed file unless it 
    needs to  read from  the file.   If enough  memory is available, the 
    entire file  may be  loaded once  and thus  leave the  file free for 
    exclusive access by other processes. 
 
    The second technique is called "file sharing".  It is a function  of 
    DOS and requires  DOS version 3.0  or later.  LIST  opens the viewed 
    files with a DENY NONE request.  This allows other processes to read 
    and write to the  file if they do  not request exclusive use  of the 
    file.  If a file  is not available to  LIST because it is  locked by 
    another process, you will receive the error message "File not found" 
    or "Access denied".  There is  no command to enable or  disable this 
    method of file sharing.  It is implicit with the use of DOS  version 
    3 and later. 
 
 

Invoking DOS Commands 
 
    If the "goto DOS" option is enabled, you may invoke DOS commands  by 
    using the Alt-G command.  LIST reserves about 60k of memory for  its 
    own use.  This increases LIST's memory requirements to approximately 
    96k when using Alt-G.  The remaining memory is available to the  DOS 
    commands.  Alt-G  clears  the  screen and  invokes  the  DOS command 
    processor. 
 
    After you  have finished  entering DOS  commands, use  the DOS  EXIT 
    command to return to LIST. 
 
    To disable the "goto DOS" function, you must use DEBUG to alter  the 
    option  byte  described  in  the  section  about  cloning.   With it 
    disabled, LIST requires less memory, about 66K.

    If the screen saving option  is enabled, LIST saves the  contents of 
    the current  display screen  when it  starts.  You  can restore  the 
    original screen by exiting LIST with the Alt-X command. 
 
    Screen  saving  requires  approximately  10k  more  memory.  This is 
    sufficient to save  60 lines of  80 characters (EGA  8x6 mode).  See 
    the section about Configuring LIST and cloning for information about 
    enabling and disabling the screen saving feature. 
 
    The  Alt-N command toggles the screen saving feature.  Its status is 
    not displayed on the bottom Line.  The small version is the only one 
    which defaults to disabling screen saving.

LIST PLUS Display 


Changing Directories 
 
    Any subdirectories contained  in the current  directory will have  a 
    down arrow  next to  them.  If  you highlight  one of  these and hit 
    Enter you will go to that directory.  If the directory that you  are 
    in  is  a  subdirectory  itself,  there  will  be an up arrow .. and 
    selecting this will take you  up.  Thus, you can easily  move around 
    your hard disk from within LIST! 
 

List file 
 
    This invokes LIST just as  you would from DOS. Simply  highlight the 
    file that you wish to view, enter a carriage return, and you will be 
    in LIST looking  at the selected  file.  When you  are finished, you 
    may escape back to the original screen, with all of its options. 
 
    You may also open  a window and then,  using the Alt-V command,  get 
    another  file  directory  and  select  another  file to view.  Using 
    Alt-W, you can load more than two files. 
 

Copy file 
 
    This  function  allows  you  to  copy  the  selected  file  to a new 
    subdirectory.  Highlight the file you want to copy and press  ENTER. 
    You will be  prompted  for the  new  path to  which you want to copy 
    the selected file.  Enter  the path,  press ENTER,  and the  file is 
    copied to the directory you indicated. 
 

Delete file 
 
    Allows  you  to  delete  any  file  in  the current directory.  Just 
    highlight the file you want to delete and press D and ENTER. You will 
    then be prompted  to make sure  that you want  to delete this  file. 
    Enter Y if you do, and N if you do not. 
 

Edit file 
 
    Invokes the EDIT program for the selected file.  If you do not have 
    an editor called  EDIT,  create a batch file called EDIT.BAT  which 
    calls your editor with the parameters that you like. For example, 
 
                   peii %1 /pc:\pe2.pro /q

Invoke file 
 
    Executes the selected file if it has an extension of .BAT, .COM, or 
    .EXE.  LIST reserves about 80k of memory and leaves the rest for use 
    by the executed program. The I command is not listed on the menu. To 
    cancel the command, press enter at the "Options:" prompt. Otherwise, 
    supply at least one space for the program options. 
 

Move file 
 
    Move  any  file  in  the  current  directory to any other directory. 
    Select the file that you want to move by highlighting it and hitting 
    ENTER.  You will then  be prompted for a  new path.  Enter the  path 
    and the file is moved to it's new location. 
 

Path changing 
 
    This function allows  you to switch  to ANY other  directory on your 
    system without having to exit LIST!  Enter 'P' for Path, and type in 
    the full path of the directory that you would like to change to, for 
    example: C:\DNLD.  You will find yourself in the selected  directory 
    and still within LIST.  The "\" character may also be used to change 
    to another drive and/or directory. 
 

Rename 
 
    Using  this  function  you  can  rename  any  file  in  the  current 
    directory.  Highlight the  file that you  want to rename.   You will 
    then be prompted for  the new file name.   After you have entered  a 
    new file name,  you will be  prompted to make  sure that you  really 
    want to rename this file.  If so, then respond with a 'Y'; if you've 
    changed  your  mind,  just  answer  with  an  'N'  and  the renaming 
    procedure will be abandoned. 
 

Sort filenames 
 
    Allows you to sort the files in the current directory by file  name, 
    extension, date, or size.  Once you have completed the operation you 
    will find yourself back at the menu screen of LIST. The sort methods 
    include F (by filename), E (by extension), D (by date), S (by size), 
    and N (no sort).  You  may add a  minus sign  to the  sort method to 
    sort in descending, rather than ascending, order.

Attribute display/change 
 
    The A command can be used to display a file's attribute and to change 
    them. There are four types of files attributes that can be changed. 
    A letter is assigned to each one: 
                A - archive flag is on (file has not changed) 
                S - the file is a system file, e.g. MSDOS.SYS 
                H - the file is hidden 
                R - the file is read-only (can not be deleted or changed) 
 
    The attribute command displays the status of the attributes in lower 
    case or upper case letters. Lower case means the attribute is off, and 
    upper case means the attribute is on, e.g. 'H' means the file is hidden, 
    and 'h' means the file is not hidden. You may supply one or more of 
    the attribute letters to change the current file's attributes.

1-9 up display 
 
    This function lets you set the display to anywhere from 1 to 9  file 
    names per line.   In subdirectories with  few numbers of  files, you 
    will begin to see not only file name, but file size, date, time, and 
    attributes as well.  You can customize this to suit your tastes. The 
    1-up display includes a display of the file attributes. These are: 
 
             A - archive bit is on, the file is unchanged 
             H - the file is hidden 
             R - the file is marked read-only 
             S - the file is a system file 
 

ViewArc 
 
    This function will let you  view the directory of an  archive (.ARC, 
    .ZIP, etc.) file, or self-extracting .COM and .EXE archive files. 
 
    After you have viewed the desired file's directory, press ESCape  to 
    return to the  file selection menu,  or use the  Alt-I (insert file) 
    command to display a file within the archive file. 
 
    The directory listing is written to a temporary file in  the current 
    directory and is called  FVFVFVFV.FV$.  You may  tell LIST  to place 
    the  temporary  file elsewhere  by setting  an  environment variable 
    called LIST.  For example, to place all ViewArc and  Alt-I extracted 
    temporary files on drive D in the subdirectory called TEMP,  use the 
    DOS SET command prior to invoking LIST: 
 
                     SET LIST=D:\TEMP 
 
            To view  archive directories,  the program  FV.COM is 
            required.  It must be located in a directory included 
            in your DOS PATH. 
 
 
            To display files within an ARChive file, the  program 
            ARCE.COM is required. It must be in your DOS PATH. For 
            ZIP files, the program PKUNZIP  must  be in your PATH. 
 
            Files with a .COM or .EXE extension are assumed to be 
            self-extracting LHARC (.LZH) files.

______________________________________________________________________________

Screen Colors 

 
    The screen's lines may be in one of three different colors: 
 
                o  the 'special' color for the top status line and the 
                   bottom command line 
                o  the 'normal' color for the file's text windows 
                o  the 'bright' color for lines with Find/Scan text, 
                   and for the upside-down question mark in 7-bit mode 
 
    There is a pair  of function keys assigned  to each color.  You  use 
    these  function  keys  at  any  time  to  change  the background and 
    foreground colors temporarily, or  use the Alt-C cloning  command to 
    make the colors permanent.  Alt-C requires that the LIST.COM program 
    file be on the current drive and in the current directory unless you 
    are using DOS version 3.3 or later.  With DOS 3.3, the program  file 
    may have any name and may reside in any subdirectory. 
 
    The border  is not  changed.  The  foreground color  applies to  the 
    color of the characters. 
 
    You may clone a  second set of text  colors for the second,  and any 
    other windows that you may create. 
 
    The color attributes may be changed by using these function keys: 
 
          For the main body of text: 
 
                F5 - background color 
                F6 - foreground color 
 
          For the top and bottom lines: 
 
                F7 - background color 
                F8 - foreground color 
 
          For the line with Find/Scan text: 
 
                F2 - background color 
                F4 - foreground 
 
    Once you have decided upon the colors, use the Alt-C key combination 
    to  change  the  LIST.COM  program  file.  This process is described 
    below.

Cloning 

 
    The screen colors, the display retrace testing (M), the file sharing 
    (S), ruler (Alt-R), and other options may be permanently set in  the 
    program COM file by using the Alt-C cloning function. 
 
    For cloning to  take effect, the  program should be  called LIST.COM 
    and on the current drive and in the current directory. 
 
    There  are  THREE  versions  of  the  LIST program file.  One is the 
    normal full program, which is LISTR.COM. The other, which is  called 
    LISTS.COM, is a slightly smaller file that excludes the Help screen. 
    The third is LIST PLUS,  found as LIST.COM.  You may use any of  the 
    three  COM  files  for  cloning.   After  cloning,  you may continue 
    viewing  the  file.   Several  of  the  command  toggles  are   also 
    'clonable'. 
 
    The values and toggles that are cloned are: 
 
             M      =  Mono monitor, affects retrace testing. If you see 
                       "snow" on your color monitor, turn off this option 
 
             Alt-S  =  file(s) are shared 
 
             W      =  Wrap long lines 
 
             8/7/*  =  display all 256 values, or 7-bit, or special case 
 
             K      =  flush Keyboard each time a command is read 
 
             Alt-H  =  hex dump display, like the DEBUG format 
 
             Alt-J  =  toggle "junk" filter, add LF to CR, fix backspaces 
 
             Alt-L  =  set on to force preloading (reading) of the entire 
                       file before any lines are displayed; default is OFF 
 
             Alt-N  =  toggles screen saving (see Alt-X) feature 
 
             Alt-R  =  toggle columnar ruler on top line 
 
             Alt-T  =  toggle expansion of TAB characters (also Ctrl-I) 
 
             Alt-V  =  number of filenames per line and sort method 
 
             F2     =  change background color for Find/Scan text 
             F4     =  change foreground color for Find/Scan text

Configuring LIST 
______________________________________________________________________________

Cloning 

             F5     =  change background color for main body of display 
             F6     =  change foreground color for main body of display 
 
             F7     =  change background color for top and bottom lines 
             F8     =  change foreground color for top and bottom lines 
 
    Note:  Be  sure  you  have  no  other  copies  of LIST.COM which are 
    accessible (because  of an APPEND   type  of utility).   If you  are 
    familiar with the DOS utility DEBUG, you may want to modify LIST  in 
    that way.  This is described in the next section.

Limitations 
______________________________________________________________________________

 
 
     o  The LIST.COM  program requires about  64K  of memory.   If  more 
        memory is available,  it is used  to store more  of the file  in 
        memory.  At least 80K is required  to use the DOS shell, and  9K 
        more is required if the screen saving option (on by default)  is 
        enabled. 
 
 
     o  The line number is currently limited to 16 million. 
 
 
     o  The file size is limited to 16 million bytes for ASCII  files, 
        and 4 million bytes for hex-dump files.  Versions for larger 
        files are available to licensed users. 
 
     o  The review limit is 32 files for the regular and Plus versions. 
        The bookmark limit is 10 entries. 
 
     o  PC DOS Version 2.0 or  later is required.  DOS version 3.0  or 
        later is required for file sharing. 
 
 
     o  ANSI.SYS is NOT required.

    ($20 suggested)  will be  greatly appreciated.   Please make  checks 
    payable in U.S. dollars to  Vernon D. Buerg.  Canadian and  non-U.S. 
    checks require excessive bank charges.
