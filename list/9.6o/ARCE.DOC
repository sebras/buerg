  ARCE Command						Version 4.0g
  ------------					      April 13, 1991


  Purpose:  Use ARCE to extract files from an ARC archive file.

  Format:   The program name may be either ARCE or ARC-E.

	ARCE  [d:][path]filename.ext  [filespecs...] [d:outpath]
				      [/R]
				      [/Q]
				      [/P]
				      [/T]
				      [/5]
				      [/Gpassword]

  Remarks:

	The drive and path names are optional.	If omitted, the  current
	drive and path name is used.

	The filename must be  supplied.  The extension defaults  to ARC.
	All files matching the supplied filename are processed.  The ARC
	filename may contain the * and ? wildcard characters.

	If  no	filespecs  are	 supplied,  all  files	are   extracted.
	Otherwise, only those ARC members  which match one of the  up to
	16 filespecs are extracted.

	The extracted files  may be placed  on another drive,  and/or in
	another subdirectory by following the optional filespecs with  a
	drive designator and/or path name.

	If  the  file  being  extracted  already  exists,  you are asked
	whether or not you want to over-write it.  You may use the |  /R
	option to bypass this prompt.  Use a Y followed by the |  return
	key to over-write the file.

	Use the /Q option to suppress alarm sounds, beeps, and bells.

	Use  the  /P  option  to  write  the  extracted files to the DOS
	standard output  file.	With  /P, you  may pipe  or redirect the
	output.  An initial line feed  is added to the beginning  of the
	output file.

	Use the /T option to test the archive's integrity. No files will
	be extracted.

	If the file was encrypted, use the /G option to supply the  same
	password as was used to create the file, e.g. /GSECRET.

	Use the /5 option to stop ARCE from creating the subdirectories
	for files created with the ARC /Z subdirectory option.

  ------------					     April 13, 1991


	o  Extract all file from TEST.ARC onto the current drive:

	      ARCE TEST

	o  Extract only file with  an extension of .ASM from the archive
	   SOURCE.ARC on drive B and in subdirectory SAVE:

	      ARCE B:\SAVE\SOURCE *.ASM

	o  Extract  all  files	from  all  ARC files in the subdirectory
	   called TEST on drive C:

	      ARCE C:\TEST\*

	o  Extract  all  files	from  PROGA.ARC  and  place the files in
	   subdirectory OLD on drive B:

	      ARCE PROGA.ARC B:\OLD

	o  Extract all files with an extension of .COM and .EXE from the
	   archive PROGS.ARC in directory NEW\WORK on drive B, and place
	   the	them  in  subdirectory	SAVE\TEST  on  drive  A; replace
	   existing file:

	      ARCE B:\NEW\WORK\PROGS *.COM *.EXE A:\SAVE\TEST /R

	o  Extract  the  file  READ.ME	from  the  archive GIZMO.ARC and
	   display it on the console instead of writing it to a file:

	      ARCE GIZMO READ.ME /P

	o  Same as above, except  pass the extracted READ.ME file to the
	   LIST file viewer:

	      ARCE GIZMO READ.ME /P | LIST /S

			Error Messages
			--------------

      'filename - premature EOF reading '

	Data  is  missing  from  the  archive  file.   The  program   is
	terminated.


      'filename - unable to set file datestamp'

	The file datestamp is set to the current date and time, and  the
	next archive member is processed.


      'filename - WARNING: file CRC does not match!'

	The extracted member  is left on  the output disk,  and the next
	archive member is processed.   The file is probably  invalid but
	is left on the disk for your examination.


      'Invalid filespec(s)'

	The filespec syntax is incorrect.  The filename part may be from
	1  to  eight  characters,  and	may  include the ? or * wildcard
	characters.  The extension may be none to three characters,  and
	may  include  wildcards.   There  is  a  maximum of 16 filespecs
	allowed.  The program terminates.


      'filename - file already exists. Overwrite it? (y/N) '

	The member being extracted already  exists.  If you are using  a
	data  path  utility,  the  file  may  not  actually  be  in  the
	subdirectory be used for output.   Respond with the letter Y  to
	over-write the existing  file, or respond  with the letter  N to
	skip this member and continue to the next.


      'Abort: Stack overflow'

	The member  being extracted  has invalid  data.  The  program is
	terminated.


      'filename - invalid decode tree count'

	The member  being extracted  has invalid  data.  The  program is
	terminated.

			Error Messages (cont'd)
			--------------


      'filename - new archive format 7 not yet supported'

	Format 7 is a special file compression method used internally by
	SEA,  the  authors  of	ARC.  Processing continues with the next
	archive member.


      'Unable to open archive > arcname'

	The  specified	ARC   archive  file  was   not	found,	or   was
	inaccessible.  The program terminates.


      'CREATE failed > filename'

	There was insufficient directory  space, or a failure  accessing
	the output disk.  The program terminates.


	'Invalid archive format!'

	The archive file data is invalid.  The program terminates.


      'Incorrect DOS version'

	Version  2.0  or  later  of  PC  DOS  must be used.  The program
	terminates


      'Not enough memory.'

	A minimum  of 112k  bytes of  memory is  required.  The  program
	terminates.


      'I/O error reading from arcname'

	An incorrectable error occurred attempting to read data from the
	archive file.  The program terminates.


      'I/O error writing or disk full > filename'

	There was not  enough disk space  to write the	complete archive
	member.   The  partially  extracted  file  is  scratched and the
	program terminates.
