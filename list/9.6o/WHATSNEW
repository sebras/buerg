                           Command Line Switches
                           ---------------------

      /?  displays LIST usage information

      /B  tells LIST to use the BIOS for displaying data.

      /D  forces display of the File Selection menu for the specified files,
          e.g. *.TXT for only .TXT files; a filespec must be supplied.
      /E  tells LIST to begin displaying the files at the end of each file
          instead of at the beginning.
      /K  disables the mouse.  Both the /M and /K mouse options are clonable.
      /Q  toggles sounding of beeps and bells; same function as the alt-Q
          command.
      /V  causes a verify function to be performed after any Copy or Move
          function

      /4  places LIST into 43/50 display mode; this requires an EGA or VGA
          display adapter.

      /1  places LIST Enhanced into 132-column mode
      /C  for LIST Enhanced, lock columns on left side of display
      /N  for LIST Enhanced, lock first file lines on top of display

      /@filename specifies a file containing a list of names of files to
          display; the @ (at symbol) can be used in the viewer to get a list
          of selected files

      /Ttext  searches all files immediately for the 'text' and is case
          sensitive.  The /Ftext or /Ttext parameter must be the last on the
          command line.  Both cannot be used at one time.

      /Ftext  begins a text search through all selected files now invokes the
          Find function which is NOT case sensitive.

      /#nnnnnn  supplies the record number from which the display is to begin.

      - The /L, /W, /M, /S, and /J command line switches now allow for
        disabling the function (in case LIST was cloned with the option on).
        To do this, add a minus sign, e.g.  /-W or /W- will set wrap off.  The
        B, D, and Q switches are toggles.  That is, specifying them reverses
        the default (or cloned setting).

LIST Version 9.6o/2.40          WHAT'S NEW                         Aug 30, 2002

                        New Operational Features
                        ------------------------

      - the program files are LISTS.COM (small), LISTR.COM (regular),
        LIST.COM, and LISTEDMB.COM (Enhanced for 500mb files);

      - The LIST environment variable tells LIST where to place temporary
        files for the ViewArc and archive extraction functions, e.g.

                SET LIST=C:\TEMP

        If the LIST variable is not set, the TEMP environment variable
        is used. If TEMP is not set, the current directory is used to
        store temporary and extracted files.

     -  All DEBUG offsets and information have been replaced by a new
        program called LISTOPT which is used to set defaults and options.
        LISTOPT is available to registered and licensed users only.

     -  The unregistered version of LIST Plus does not support network drives.
        This is due to companies using the shareware version on networks, and
        not getting a license.

        LISTOPT now supports entering registration information so that new
        versions may be downloaded and registered by the user alone.

      - The ? (question mark) Help command has been changed for LIST Enhanced
        to view the online manual. This requires the LISTHELP.COM and LIST.HLP
        files be in the same directory as the LIST.COM file.

      - The maximum "logical" record size has been increased from 910 to 2048.

      - A second Help screen is now available in the Plus version which shows
        all of the Ctrl- and cursor key functions

      - An improvement in speed is available when all filter options are set
        off.  Use alt-Z to display the toggles on the bottom line.  An option
        is off when its corresponding letter, e.g.  'J' for alt-J junk filter
        or 'T' for the alt-T tab expansion filter, is in lower case.

      - The Viewarc function now assumes that .EXE and .COM files are self-
        extracting files and will actually execute them to extract the selected
        file.  Not all self-extracting programs support this.  Otherwise, if a
        file does not have the .ARC, .LZH, .ZIP, .PAK, or .SDN extension, the
        file is assumed to be a .ARC file.

      - The top status line while viewing a file has changed.  Until the last
        record number is known, LIST now displays a percentage of the file read
        so far.

LIST Version 9.6o/2.40          WHAT'S NEW                         Aug 30, 2002

                        Long File Names
                        ---------------

      - Long file names are supported under Windows 95, 98, Me, and 2000

      - A single long file name may be entered on the command line when
        using Windows 9x, Me, or 2000

      - The alt-F (get new filename) command now accepts a long file name
        including drive and path

      - The 1-up File Selection Men display includes the first part of the
        long file name - up to 95 characters.

      - The long file name is preserved for move and copy operations. The
        maximum length of a path name is 76 characters which means that
        directories with very long path names may not be accessible.

      - The @ command (available while viewing a file) shows a list of files
        that have been viewed. The path and file name are short names.

      - A new ~ (tilde) command under Windows 9x while viewing a file displays
        the file's long file name and other information.

      - Long file names may not be available on NTFS volumes

LIST Version 9.6o/2.40          WHAT'S NEW                         Aug 30, 2002

                              File Selection Menu
                              -------------------

      - New commands are available from the File Selection (Alt-V) menu:

              E    invokes the 'Edit' editor to let you edit the selected file;
                   create a BATch file called EDIT.BAT which invokes the
                   editor of your choice with the optional parameters it needs

              I    invokes (executes) the selected program; replying ESCape to
                   the "Options:" prompt cancels the command; at least one
                   space is required: a null <enter> cancels the command.

              *    refreshes the directory display

          Alt-Z    toggles the status display on the bottom line from disk and
                   file statistics line to a menu command help line

|         Ctl-S    executes the program associated with the selected file,
|                  e.g. Wordpad for .DOC, WinAmp for .MP3, ACDSee for .JPG

|         Alt-D    toggles whether or not directory entries are included
|                  when sorting the file selection menu; the default is
|                  to exclude them so that all directory entries show at
|                  the beginning of the list

|         Ctl-V    executes the program LXPIC.COM to view a graphic image file
|                  for the selected file

      - Changes to other file selection menu (Alt-V) commands:

        -  Q)uit returns you to the display of the last file you viewed
           if no file has been displayed, Q exits to DOS.

        -  the X command exits to DOS in the NEW (current) directory

        -  ESCape exits to DOS in the ORIGINAL directory

        -  Alt-X exits to DOS and shows the original screen

        -  the 1-up display now includes the file attributes

        -  Alt-C saves (clones) the settings

        - the S)ort command now has a None (no sort) ordering option, and a
          minus "-" prefix option for sorting in descending order; ESCape now
          cancels the S)ort request. The descending sort option is clonable.

        -  a \ may be used in place of the P)ath command to change directories

      -  the F2 command to toggle the bottom line status display has been
         changed to F3

      -  you may press the shift key and a letter key to move the selection
         to the first filename beginning with that letter, e.g. shift-C will
         put the cursor on the first file name beginning with the letter 'c'

      -  new alt-F7 and alt-F8 commands change the color of the bar for the
         current file entry at the cursor position
LIST Version 9.6o/2.40          WHAT'S NEW                         Aug 30, 2002

                                 New Commands
                                 ------------

      - A new Ctrl-G command in the viewer sets the length of fixed length
        records using the length of the first record displayed. This
        supplements Ctrl-B which is used to manually enter the length.

      - A new Ctrl-L command toggles the display of page breaks

      - Added video mode T for ATI Graphics Ultra Plus adapters

      - The Ctrl-O (control printer output) command has been expanded to
        offer more choices, i.e. portrait, landscape, condensed, and normal
        print modes. Only the printers supporting the HP PCL (laserjet and
        deskjet) printers are supported. For other printers, some patches
        are available. LISTOPT will eventually allow for printer codes to
        be supplied by the user.

      - A new ctrl-Y command saves the current position as a bookmark, and
        alt-Y repositions to the last bookmark. You may set up to 10 bookmarks.

      - A new 1 command restarts displaying files with the first file.

      - A new Ctrl-right command scrolls the screen right to the end of the
        current line.

      - A new O command toggles the date format from U.S. mm/dd/yy to
        European format dd-mm-yy and is clonable.

      - A new % (percent) command toggles whether LIST displays the file's last
        line number or percentage of file read.

      - The Rename command will change a directory or file name to a long
        file name under Windows 9x. Only the first 55 characters are used.

      - The registered and licensed versions of LIST Plus and LIST Enhanced
        support access to network drives. This includes Novell, Lantastic,
        and MS Clients such as Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95/98 and
        Windows NT. To access MS Client drives, map the client drive
        as a local drive either through the NET USE command, or through a
        Windows application such as Explorer. LIST does not yet recognize
        the syntax \\computer\resource in place of d:\path.

      - To execute LIST from a server drive, the server version is required.

LIST Version 9.6o/2.40          WHAT'S NEW                         Aug 30, 2002

                                Changed Commands
                                ----------------

      - The X command exits to DOS and clears the screen. In the Plus version,
        you are now placed in the new (selected) directory.

      - The Alt-D and Alt-O (write lines to a file) commands have been changed
        to default to writing a found (highlighted line after Scan or Find)
        line if no lines have been marked.

      - All command which as for a d:\path and/or a filename now check for
        embedded blanks and non-valid characters.

      - The ctrl-I command has been added to the Plus version.  It allows
        setting the TAB interval to values other than the standard 8.  Ctrl-I
        prompts you to enter the new interval, which can be from 1 to 99.

      - The ctrl-T dial command will initially place the cursor on a line
        with found text, i.e. you scan for a name and LIST find it. The found
        text is highlighted. When you issue ctrl-T, the cursor is placed there.
        LIST copies all numbers and valid telephone number characters, like
        dash and comma, up to the first non-numeric character as the phone
        number. Sending of a '1' prefix has been removed. If the modem fails
        to dial initially, press the <spacebar> to try a re-dial.

      - The File Selection C)opy and M)ove commands check for sufficient space
        on the target drive before copying the file.

      - The Alt-E video mode switching command now recognizes VESA and will
        offer a selection of VESA modes which the display adapter supports.
        Only extended text modes are offered, e.g. 132 by 25.

      - Use Ctrl-J while viewing a file to toggle on VESA detection. If off,
        alt-E will present a menu which includes a value for the video card.
        Use the 0 (zero) subcommand to select your card's manufacturer. If you
        are unsure, keep pressing 0 until the code is I. LIST will attempt to
        determine the SVGA letter code. You may clone the setting if successful.


      - The alt-F command now accepts a long file name, up to 70 characters

|     - The file copy function from the File Selection Menu has a new option.
|       In addition to the Y, N, S options, you may now specify the U option.
|       This results in copying only those files which do not exist in the
|       target directory. The check is for duplicate file names only and does
|       not check for duplicate files with different date/timestamps.

        Examples of using DEBUG can be found in the DIALER.PAT and
        COLORS.PAT files. To use them, copy LIST.COM to the current
        directory and issue the DEBUG command. For example:

                DEBUG <DIALER.PAT
