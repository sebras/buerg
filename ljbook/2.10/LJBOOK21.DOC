--------------                                                   April  4, 1988


Purpose:

    LJBOOK prints  text documents  in a  book format.   There are four pages
    printed on each sheet of paper; two pages on each side of the paper.  An
    HP LaserJet is required.  The  Y cartridge font is recommended,  but any
    font capable of line printer, landscape, 8.5 point print may be used.  A
    downloadable font called BOLD18.USL is supplied, but it requires special
    processing.

Syntax:

    LJBOOK  filename  [output]  [/f]  [/p]  [/d]  [/2] [/B] [/t...]

Remarks:

    The 'filename' is  required.  It specifies  the name of  the file to  be
    printed.  A drive and/or path name may be used.

    The 'output'  file name  is optional.   If omitted,  the standard output
    printer device is used, i.e.   LPT1: or PRN: devices.  If  supplied, the
    output is written to the specfied file instead of to the printer.

    There are two pages printed on each of the two sides of the paper.  Each
    side consists of a title line and up to 66 lines of 80 characters each.

    Eighty characters are printed on each line.  If the file's lines  exceed
    80 characters, the lines are  wrapped so that 80 characters  are printed
    on each line until the entire file's line has been processed.

    TAB control characters are expanded and effect line length.

    A new page  is started after  66 lines have  been printed, or  if a form
    feed (hex 0C) is encounterd.

    After the first side has been printed, remove the printed paper from the
    stacker and place it into the paper tray.  The orientation of the  paper
    in the tray depends on the printer model and method of stacking used.

    On a LaserJet Plus with the  standard paper stacker, the paper is  moved
    from the stacker to the tray without rotating or turning.


    Specify /p to generate page numbering  and to place the page numbers  at
    the top of each page.

    Specify /d to add the current date and time to the top of each page.

    Specify /f to place the file's name at the top of each page.

    Specify /2 to print on one side only, two pages on each sheet.

    Specify /B to tell LJBOOK  that you have downloaded the  BOLD18.USL font
    which  prints  18  pitch,  7.68  point,  bold, in landscape orientation.
    Otherwise, it  is assumed  that the  current primary  font is capable of
    16.66 pitch,  8.5 point,  landscape orientation  as supplied  with the Y
    font cartridge.  The BOLD18 font and the modifications to LJBOOK for its
    use were supplied by R.W. Smetana.  Please submit your modifications  to
    me.  You  may not  distribute a  modified version  of LJBOOK  without my
    permission.

    Specify /t followed by up to  40 characters of text, to supply  your own
    title for the  top of each  page.  You can  not use both  the /f and  /t
    options together.  If supplied, the /t parameter must be the last one.

    After printing the first side, the paper should be loaded back into  the
    printer such that the last page printed  is on top and the LAST edge  of
    the paper that came out of the printer is the FIRST edge of the paper to
    go back in.

    PC DOS version 2.0 or later is required.  About 64k of memory is needed.
    For personal use only.  May not be sold.
