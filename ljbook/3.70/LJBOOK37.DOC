LJBOOK Command                                                     Version 3.70

Purpose:

    LJBOOK prints  text documents  in a  book format.   There are four pages
    printed on each sheet of paper; two pages on each side of the paper.  An
    HP LaserJet is required.  The  Y cartridge font is recommended,  but any
    font capable of line printer, landscape, 8.5 point print may be used. An
    internal landscape font is available.

Syntax:

    LJBOOK  filename  [output1 [output2] ]
|                     [/F] [/P] [/D] [/A] [/B] [/R] [/U] [/M] [/N] [/I] [/W]
                      [/2] [/X] [/C]
                      [/T...]

Remarks:

    The 'filename' is  required.  It specifies  the name of  the file to  be
    printed.  A drive and/or path name may be used.

    The 'output1' and 'output2' file names are optional.  If omitted, the
    standard output printer device is used, i.e. LPT1: or PRN: devices.
    If supplied, the output is written to the specfied file(s) instead
    of to the printer.  Use two output names when printing to a network
    spooler or printer server. The file 'output1' contains the first side
    and the second side unless 'output2' is specified. The file 'output2'
    contains the second side.

    There are two pages printed on each of the two sides of the paper.  Each
    side consists of a title line and up to 66 lines of 80 characters each.

    Eighty characters are printed on each line.  If the file's lines  exceed
    80 characters, the lines are  wrapped so that 80 characters  are printed
    on each line until the entire file's line has been processed.

    TAB control characters are expanded and effect line length.

    A new page  is started after  66 lines have  been printed, or  if a form
    feed (hex 0C) is encounterd.  DO NOT END THE FILE WITH A FORM FEED!

    After the first side has been printed, remove the printed paper from the
    stacker and place it into the paper tray.  The orientation of the  paper
    in the tray depends on the printer model and method of stacking used.

    On a LaserJet Plus with the  standard paper stacker, the paper is  moved
    from the stacker to the tray without rotating or turning.   The  printer
    is reset after the file has been printed if /R is used.

    On a LaserJet IIP with multipurpose (MP)tray, change the output tray
    selector to the down position (so that paper goes to the face up output
    tray).  After the first side is printed, change the output tray selector
    back to the up position and move the paper from the output tray to the MP
    tray without rotating or turning.

--------------                                                     Feb 02, 2000


    /A  -  set margins for use with A4 size paper (vmi=5.2)

    /B  -  use downloaded font with ID of 1 (see below)

    /C  -  continuous printing: do not pause between the printing of side 1
           and side 2, but set manual feed on the printer so that the operator
           must change paper after printing 1. This option is intended for use
           with networked printers.

    /D  -  add the current date and time to the top of each page

    /F  -  place the file's name at the top of each page

    /I  -  indent left margins for hole punching and print cut line on
           each page

    /M  -  print to a DeskJet printer (vmi=5.2, typeface 3)

    /N  -  skip prompt to press enter before beginning to print

    /P  -  generate page numbering  and to place the page numbers  at
           the top of each page

    /R  -  RESET the printer before and after printing the file

    /T  -  print supplied text on top title line of each page (see below)

    /U  -  underline the top title line

|   /W  -  enable line wrap; lines over 80 characters are continued on the
|          next line; the default is for wrap to be off

    /X  -  use duplex mode on an HP LJ II-D or III-D

    /2  -  print on one side only, two pages on each sheet


    Specify /B to tell LJBOOK that you wish to use the internal LJBOOK font
    which prints 18 pitch, 7.68 point, bold, in landscape orientation.  If
    you specify /B, LJBOOK downloads its own font and assigns a font ID of
    1 to it.  Otherwise, it is assumed that the current primary font is
    capable of 16.66 pitch, 8.5 point, landscape orientation as supplied
    with the Y font cartridge.  The /B option need be specified only for
    the first file to be printed as long as the printer is not reset.


    Specify /T followed by up to  40 characters of text, to supply  your own
    title for the  top of each  page.  You can  not use both  the /f and  /t
    options together.  If supplied, the /T parameter must be the last one.


    After printing the first side, the paper should be loaded back into  the
    printer such that the last page printed  is on top and the LAST edge  of
    the paper that came out of the printer is the FIRST edge of the paper to
    go back in.

    If you're spooling LJBOOK to a network printer, try using this statement:

        NET USE LPT1 \\[network-printer-name]
