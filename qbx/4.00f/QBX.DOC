  QBX - Quick Basic Cross Referencer			  Version  4.00f
  (c) Copyright Vernon D. Buerg 1986-88 		  July 15,  1988
  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.



  Purpose
  -------

	Determines cross references to alphanumeric labels and symbols
	within a BASIC source program.

  Syntax
  ------

|	QBX [filename[.BAS]]  [/D]	    [/Lnn]  [/Cnnn]  [/R]
			      [/P]
			      [/F[(filename)]]
			      [/N]

  Remarks
  -------

	If no filename is supplied, you are prompted to enter the
	file name of the BASIC source file. The source file must
	have been saved in ASCII (,A) format. The program may contain
	any valid combination of numeric and alphameric labels. The
	syntax is dictated by the Microsoft Quick Basic Compiler manual
	and the IBM BASIC, Version 3.1, manual.

	The source file may contain TAB characters but their use
	may cause the listing to be mis-aligned.

	The output consists of a program listing and a cross-reference
	listing. The destination for the listing may be specified in
	the command as:

		/D  display listings on the console display
		/P  print the listings on the LPT1: printer
		/F  write the listings to a file; may be supplied as (filename)
		/N  suppress all listings

	For example, /F(MYPROG.LST) sets a destination of a file with
	the name MYPROG.LST. If no extension is supplied, .LST is used
	for the program listing and .REF is used for the cross-reference
	listing.

	If no destination parameter is supplied, you will be asked to supply
	it.

	The number of lines per page may be suppied by the /L parameter,
	for example /L66 sets a default of 66 lines per page.

	The number of columns per line may be supplied by the /C parameter,
	for example /C132 sets a default of 133 columns per line.

|	Actual file record (line) numbers may be used instead of statement
|	numbers by supplying the /R option.


  Meta Commands
  -------------

	The source file may contain the meta commands described in
	the Quick Basic (versions 1 or 2) manuals. These meta commands
	are currently recognized:

		$INCLUDE  - cause QBX to include the named file with
			    the current source program, and may be nested
			    to approximately 15 levels;
		$LINESIZE - sets the number of characters per page;
		$PAGESIZE - sets the number of program lines per page;

		$PAGE	  - forces a new listing page
		$SKIP	  - inserts one blank line into the listing
		$SKIP:n   - inserts "n" blank lines into the listing
		$SUBTITLE - adds a subtitle to each listing page second line
		$TITLE	  - adds a title to each listing page; if none
			    are supplied, the title is "QBX"

  Operation
  ---------

	There are two parts to the operation of QBX. The first phase
	produces a program listing and builds the internal tables
	representing the program's labels and symbols. The second
	phase produces a label and a symbol cross reference.

	The output from each phase may be directed to the screen,
	a printer (LPT1), a file, or nowhere. You are prompted for
	the destination.

	The format of the listings is governed by two values: the
	number of lines per page, and the number of columns per line.
	You supply  both values. The defaults are 66 lines per page
	and 80 columns. You may over-ride these values by using the
	meta commands $PAGESIZE and $LINESIZE in the program. If the
	console is used for output, the values are always set to 24
	lines and 80 columns with an option at the end of each page
	to pause or continue.

	You must set your printer to the appropriate lines and columns
	values before running QBX. It does not send any printer codes.

	The internal tables contain the labels, symbols, and cross
	reference information. The current limits are 2500 labels and
	symbols, and approximately 16000 cross references (depends
	upon the amount of memory available. There is also a limit
	off 200 fields per statement. A field is a symbol, label,
	delimiter, or operator. These values are summarized at the
	end of program execution.

|	You may terminate processing by pressing the ESCape key.

  Notes
  -----

	Copyright Vernon D. Buerg 1986-88.  All rights reserved.

	QBX was written using the Microsoft Quick Basic Compiler,
	Version 3.00, and one assembler subroutine. At least 128K
	of memory is required, but 192K or more is recommended. The
	additional memory is used to increase the limits of the numbers
	of labels, symbols and cross references that QBX can process.


	QBX is	supplied  for  personal,  private  use. Feel free to
	distribute QBX given these restrictions:

	  o  the program  shall be supplied in its original,  unmodified
	     form, which includes this documentation;

	  o  no fee is charged;

	  o  "commmercial" use without a license is prohibited;

	  o  the program may not be included -	or bundled - with  other
	     goods or services.  Exceptions may be granted upon  written
	     request only.  This also applies to clubs and distributors.


	If you find QBX of value, your gift of $15, or any amount, would
	be greatly appreciated.
