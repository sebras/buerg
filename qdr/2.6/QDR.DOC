 -----------                                                 Nov 9, 1986
 
 
 Purpose
 -------
        Re-format a floppy  disk quickly, optionally  with a new  volume
        label, deleting all files and sub-directories.
 
 Format
 ------
                QDR [d:][label]  [/F][/1][/3][/4][/8] [/N] [/V]
 
 Remarks
 -------
        The d: parameter supplies the drive letter, A to K. If no  drive
        letter  is  supplied,  A  is  used.   A  fixed  disk  can not be
        re-formatted.
 
        You may supply a volume label (up to 11 characters)  immediately
        following the drive letter.  For example:
 
                QDR b:scratch
 
        The /N option suppresses  the "press ENTER to  continue" prompt.
        Otherwise, press  the enter  key to  reformat the  disk, or  the
        ESCape key to cancel.
 
        Use the /F option to force a full format of all tracks.  The /1,
        /3, /4, and /8 options apply to a full format.
 
        Bad clusters remain marked as bad unless a full format is
        used, then clusters are marked as unusable if they can not be
        formatted.  Use the /V option to receive a display of the
        cluster numbers that are marked as not usable.
 
        The DOS error level is set to 0 for successful completion, or to
        1 if any errors occur.
 
 Options
 -------
 
        /F - forced format; uses BIOS to format and verify each track
        /1 - forces single sided format, SSSD/8 or SSSD/9
        /3 - forces DSQD format on 720K capacity drives
        /4 - forces DSQD format on 1.2 mb drives
        /8 - forces 8-sector format; for SSSD/8 or DSDD/8
 
        /N - no prompt; skips the "Press ENTER" message and reply
        /V - verbose messages; displays a message for each cluster
             that is marked as unusable
 
 Formatting
 ----------
 
        To perform a full format of a disk sectors, use the /F  options.
        It is recommended that you use DOS FORMAT since QDR is not  much
        faster when doing a full format.  Both mark bad clusters.
 
        You may suppy /1 to force  SSSD format, /4 for DSQD (1.2mb),  or
        /3 for DSQD (720kb), or /8 for eight-sectors (SSSD or DSDD).
 
        Unless  /F  is  used,  the  diskette  must  have been previously
        formatted.  The allowable diskette  formats are: DSQD (1.2mb  or
        720kb), SSSD/8, SSSD/9, DSDD/8, and DSDD/9.  When information is
        available for other drive types, they will be added to the  data
        in the internal device table.  Your system hardware and software
        must support the device type.

 Examples
 --------

     o  Reformat a previously formatted and used diskette. Write a
        volume label of SCRATCH:
		QDR A:scratch

     o  Alternately format new diskettes in drives A and B.
	First, create a BAT file called TWOFOR.BAT with these commands:
		QDR A: /F/N
		QDR B: /F/N
		TWOFOR
	Then, issue the command TWOFOR. When the last diskette has been
        formatted, press ctrl-C to abort the program.
