SORTF Command						  Version 2.32	Page 1
-------------						  Feb 18, 1989


Purpose:   The SORTF command reads record data from a file,  sorts the
	   records, and writes the data to another file.

Format:
	   SORTF [d:][path]fname[.ext] [d:][path]fname[.ext]
		 [/+nnn[,len]] -or- [/-nnn,[len]]
		 [/Lnnn]
		 [/R] [/C] [/Q]
|		 [/K] or [/X]

Remarks:   Records are read from the input file,  sorted,  and written
	   to the output file.

	   Two types of records may be sorted:

	   1)  logical	records.   Each  record  ends  with a carriage
	       return and line feed, and  may be up to 1024 characters
	       in length.

	   2)  fixed length  records.  Each record  is of length  L as
	       defined	by  the  '/Lnnn'  parameter.   The records may
	       contain any  kind of  data, including  carriage return,
	       line feed, and end-of-file without effecting the record
	       length. The maximum record is 1024 bytes.


	   The sort  order is  in ascending  ASCII character sequence.
	   You may supply the /R  parameter to reverse the sort  order
	   for all fields, or supply /- parameters for each key  field
	   to  be  sorted  in  reverse	order.	 The  key  fields  are
	   processed from  left to  right as  supplied in  the command
	   line.

	   The /C option may be added to cause SORTF to treat the  key
	   fields  as  case  insensitive  data.   That	is, lower case
	   letters in the key field are treated as upper case letters.

	   You may  supply up  to sixteen  key offsets	and lengths by
	   using the /+ or /- parameter, one for each key position and
	   its length.	 If /+	and /-	are omitted,  the key is taken
	   from the first character position for a length of 11.

	   The position 'nnn' may be a value from one to 255.

	   The key length 'len' may be  a value from 1 to 99.   The /+
	   operand  specifies  that  the  specified  key  is sorted in
	   ascending order.  The /- specifies desending sort order for
	   that key.

	   Use the /Q option to suppress the display of  informational
	   messages.  Error messages can not be suppressed.

			Options Summary
			---------------


	   /C  specifies  that	the  keys  are	case  insensitive;  if
	       supplied, all lower case  characters in the key	fields
	       are  converted  to  upper  case	for  the  purposes  of
	       sorting.

	   /R  sort in	reverse order;	over-rides any	/- options and
	       treats them all as /+ options.

	   /Q  suppress informational messages.


	   /K  creates an output file that consists of sorted key data
	       which includes a 5-byte information prefix.

|	   /X  like /K, except that the 5-byte information prefix is
|	       omitted, and a cr/lf (carriage return and line feed)
|	       is added to each record.


	   /L  specifies the sorting of fixed length records

	   /+  defines the location  and length of  a key field  to be
	       sorted in ascending order

	   /-  defines the location  and length of  a key field  to be
	       sorted in descending order




			Invoking from Quick Basic
			-------------------------

	To invoke SORTF from a Quick Basic program, you can use either
	the SHELL or CALL statements.  Use of SHELL is straightforward.
	Use of CALL requires that you include SORTF.OBJ when you LINK
	your QB program, and that you use the /CP LINK option to ensure
	that memory is available for SORTF. For example:

	in the QB program : CALL SORTF ("test.fil new.fil /+1,12")
		     -or-   SHELL "sortf test.fil new.fil /+1,12"

	for CALL:	    LINK qbprogram + SORTF /CP:5000;

	The /CP:5000 option will limit the QB program to 80K plus the
	size of its code, data and stack. Whatever is left can be used
	by CALLed programs. That amount will be about 120K less than
	the DOS available memory.

			Examples
			--------

	 o  to	sort  a  file  in  descending order with the keys in
	   position 10:

		SORTF TEST.DAT TEST.SRT /R/+10

	 o  to sort the same file using keys with 24 characters:

		SORTF TEST.DAT TEST.SRT /R/+10,24

	 o  to sort a file of fixed length, binary records; the input
	   file contains records of 18 bytes each,  the  key is  two
	   bytes  at  position	17  in	each  record  in  descending
	   order, and 11 bytes at postion 1 in ascending order:

		SORTF SRTCATS.RND SRTCATS.IND /L18 /-17,2 /+1,12

	 o  to sort on different keys, but creating an an output file
	   with the keys only:

		SORTF TEST.DAT TEST.KEYS /-10,2 /+20,4 /-16,3 /K

	   Note the use of /-.	It specifies that the first and  third
	   keys  are  sorted  in  descending  order, the second key is
	   sorted in ascending order.

	   The format of the keys-only file using /K is:

	   Offset  Length   Contents
	   ------  ------   ------------------------------------------
	     0	     2	    Length of data record excluding CR and LF
	     2	     3	    Offset to record in input file
			     +0  hi-byte of 3-byte address offset
			     +1  low word of address offset
	     5	     n	    Variable key data, depends on key definitions

|	   The format of the keys-only file using /X is:
|
|	   Offset  Length   Contents
|	   ------  ------   ------------------------------------------
|	     0	     n	    Variable key data, depends on key definitions
|	     n	     2	    Carriage return and line feed

	   In the example above, the variable key data format is:

	     5	     2	    Data in records at offset 10
	     7	     4	    Data in records at offset 20
	    11	     3	    Data in records at offset 16
	    14	     0	    End of key record.

	   The length of  each keys-only record  is 5 plus  the sum of
	   the individual key lengths.	The default, if no /+ or /- is
	   specified, is 16 bytes each.

			Restrictions
			------------

	   Depending on the amount of  memory available,  up to  40000
	   records may be sorted.  The maximum file  size that	can be
	   sorted depends  on the  maximum number  of records  and the
	   average record  length.  For  example,  the	file  size  is
	   limited to 3.2 mb for a file consisting of 80-byte records.


	   The advantages of using  SORTF  instead of the SORT filter:
		- files larger than 63K may be sorted
		- less time is required
		- sort order can be based on up to 16 fields
		- fixed length files can be sorted

	   For	best  results,	place the  input file  on the  fastest
	   available drive, e.g. RAM disk.
